Its range encompasses only three degrees of latitude (37 ◦ 20 – 40 ◦ 20 S) with a small outlying presence in the coastal mountains of Chile (Veblen et al. 1995). The species is classified as endangered (Premoli et al. 2013) because of extensive logging and human-set fires. 
Araucaria araucana has a long history of ethnobiological importance. For centuries the Pehuén fruits have been a vital sustainable food source for the Pehuenche people (Mapuche) and today the growing industry of ecotourism indirectly serves to protect these forests (Aagesen 1998; González et al. 2013). After a long history of human destruction of A. araucana forests, which reduced its range to half its original distribution, Chile and Argentina now legally protect this endangered species. These ecosystems continue to be threatened by logging, fires, and extensive livestock use. These factors, and the potential threats posed by climate change, are among the main challenges to A. araucana conservation (González and Lara
2015).";http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature12670;672-676;vol.502 is.7473;Thomson Reuters ISI

We focus our analysis in austral summer, when the regional wind experiences significant day-to-day variability superimposed on a mean, upwelling favorable flow. To evaluate the nature and magnitude of these effects, we performed three identical simulations except for the surface forcing: the climatological run, with long-term monthly mean wind-stresses and heat fluxes; the wind-synoptic run, with daily wind stresses and climatological heat fluxes; and the full-synoptic run, with daily wind-stresses and daily fluxes. The mean currents and surface geostrophic EKE fields show no major differences between simulations, and agree well with those observed in this ocean area. Nevertheless, substantially more ageostrophic EKE is found in the simulations which include synoptic variability of wind-stresses, impacting the total surface EKE and diffusivities, particularly south of Punta Lavapie (37° S), where the lack of major currents implies low levels of geostrophic EKE. Summer mean SSTs are similar in all simulations and agree with observations, but SST variability along the coast is larger in the runs including wind-stress synoptic variability, suggesting a rather linear response of the ocean to cycles of southerly wind strengthening and relaxation. We found that coastal SST variability does not change significantly in the first tenths of kilometers from the shore when including daily heat fluxes, highlighting the prominent role of wind-driven upwelling cycles. In contrast, in the offshore region situated beyond the 50 km coastal strip, it is necessary to include synoptic variability in the heat fluxes to account for a realistic SST variability.";http://www.clim-past.net/9/1111/2013/;1111-1140;vol.9 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi- decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971-2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years.

The main components that contribute to sea-level change are analyzed and summed to achieve a total estimate of sea-level change along the coast of Chile and in the Southeast Pacific. Included are the steric/dynamic component, the contribution from land ice loss and the sea- level change due to the glacial isostatic adjustment. Regional fingerprints and global means are combined to estimate sea-level change in this area. For the steric/dynamic component two different estimates are considered. The results are compared to those found in the IPCC AR5 report. The total mean sea-level rise along the coast lies between 34 cm and 52 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario and between 46 cm and 74 cm for the RCP8.5 scenario, depending on the location and the steric/dynamic component estimate considered. This component is the main contribution in each scenario.

Diazotrophic cyanobacteria of subsection V (Order Stigonematales) are particularly ubiquitous in photoautotrophic microbial mats of hot springs. The Stigonematal cyanobacterium strain CHP1 isolated from the Porcelana hot spring (Chile) was one of the major contributors of the new nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Further morphological and genetic characterization verified that the strain CHP1 belongs to Stigonematales, and it formed a separate clade together with other thermophiles of the genera Fischerella and Mastigocladus. Strain CHP1 fixed maximum N2 in the light, independent of the temperature range. At 50 °C nifH gene transcripts showed high expression during the light period, whereas the nifH gene expression at 45 °C was arrhythmic. The strain displayed a high affinity for nitrate and a low tolerance for high ammonium concentrations, whereas the narB and glnA genes showed higher expression in light and at the beginning of the dark phase. It is proposed that Mastigocladus sp. strain CHP1 would represent a good model for the study of subsection V thermophilic cyanobacteria, and for understanding the adaptations of these photoautotrophic organisms inhabiting microbial mats in hot springs globally.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-012-0343-9;13-28;vol.42 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Despite their diazotrophic nature (N2 fixers), their impact on the nitrogen cycle in such extreme ecosystems remains unknown. Here, we surveyed the identity and activity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the neutral hot spring of Porcelana (Northern Patagonia, Chile) during 2009 and 2011-2013. We used 16S rRNA and the nifH gene to analyze the distribution and diversity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the dominance of the heterocystous genus Mastigocladus (Stigonematales) along the entire temperature gradient of the hot spring (69-38 °C). In situ nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction), nitrogen fixation rates (cellular uptake of (15)N2) and nifH transcription levels in the microbial mats showed that nitrogen fixation and nifH mRNA expression were light-dependent. Nitrogen fixation activities were detected at temperatures ranging from 58 °C to 46 °C, with maximum daily rates of 600 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) per day and 94.1 nmol N cm(-2) per day. These activity patterns strongly suggest a heterocystous cyanobacterial origin and reveal a correlation between nitrogenase activity and nifH gene expression during diurnal cycles in thermal microbial mats. N and C fixation in the mats contributed ∼3 g N m(-2) per year and 27 g C m(-2) per year, suggesting that these vital demands are fully met by the diazotrophic and photoautotrophic capacities of the cyanobacteria in the Porcelana hot spring.;http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/2793/2013/;2793-2825;vol.13 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

The resilience approach is emerging as one way to do this, and in the last decade has been strongly introduced into the policy arena, although it is not new for DRM practitioners and researchers. Nevertheless, resilience is a highly contested issue, and there is no agreed definition of it, which has resulted in confusion for stakeholders when applying it to practice. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how resilience is framed by researchers and DRM practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical framework used was Hajer's ""social-interactive discourse theory"", combined with analysis of government documents, in-depth interviews with practitioners and observation of field and practices within the context of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia. Findings: One of the key findings is that the idea of ""bouncing back"" is central to the resilience discourse but different interpretations of this idea results in real-world implications. Three different ways (storylines) in which practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience emerge from this study. Importantly the divergences between these storylines reveal possibilities for reframing to occur and these could lead to different policy options and practices.

Stakeholder participation is posited as pivotal for building resilience, and resilience is not passive; rather, stakeholders are actively involved in the process of building resilience. Who is involved and how they are involved are crucial aspects for developing resilience in practice. Nevertheless, there are few empirical studies available to inform theory or show how these issues are addressed. This study focuses on revealing how practitioners frame the issue of participation in relation to resilience, its relevance to a changing climate and how, in consequence, they construct practices.

However, few empirical studies have focused on how resilience ideas are conceptualized by practitioners, as they implement them in practice. Using Hajer's 'social-interactive discourse theory' this research contributes to the understanding of how practitioners frame, construct and make sense of resilience ideas in the context of changes in institutional arrangements for disaster risk management that explicitly include the resilience approach and climate change considerations. The case study involved the roll out of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia, and the study involved three sites in Queensland. The methods used were observation of different activities and the physical sites, revision of documents related to the Natural Disaster Resilience Program and in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants, all practitioners who had direct interaction with the program. The research findings show that practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience differently, and these are embedded in diverse storylines. Within these storylines, practitioners gave different interpretations and emphasis to the seven discourse categories that characterized their resilience discourse. Self-reliance emerged as one of the paramount discourse categories but we argue that caution needs to be used when promoting values of self-reliance. If the policy impetus is a focus on learning, research findings indicate it is also pertinent to move from experiential learning toward social learning. The results presented in this study provide helpful insights to inform policy design and implementation of resilience ideas in disaster risk management and climate change, and to inform theory.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212003199;03/12/18;vol.299;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this study we aimed to generate context-specific knowledge about resilience factors for addressing the impacts of drought, with the expectation that bringing forth experiential knowledge on how impacts were addressed in the past would shed light on what constitutes key resilience factors for practitioners working in urban contexts. The study was carried in three of the largest cities in Chile: Santiago, Concepción, and Valdivia. The analytical framework consists of urban and regional resilience incorporating transdisciplinary approaches applying the Resilience-Wheel tool, combined with participatory methods for the co-production of knowledge and qualitative content analysis of documents and workshops. Results show that key determinants of building resilience to drought were: improving education and access to information, enhancing preparedness, promoting technology transfer, reinforcing organizational linkages and collaboration, decentralizing governance, and encouraging citizen participation. The Resilience-Wheel was useful for navigating the conceptual complexity and diversity of perspectives inherent among social actors. The transdisciplinary approach allowed us to co-produce key knowledge that can be applied to build resilience in future, through a bottom-up approach that bridges the science–policy interface.;http://hol.sagepub.com/content/23/1/3;3-13;vol.23 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

This research investigated how stakeholders conceptualise climate change in terms of its seriousness and related uncertainty, and a resilience approach as a possible policy option to confront this uncertainty. An application of the conceptual framework provided by Handmer and Dovers' typology of emergencies is novel to the climate change field. Results show that there is a tendency to frame climate change as complex (with uncertainty representing part of that complexity) and to confront this complexity with less complex policies and solutions. No pattern of a conceptual link between uncertainty and resilience was observed.

We use the probability distributed model (PDM) under a data-scarce scenario and aim at correcting two key controlling factors in the streamflow generation: the rainfall forcing data and the catchment wetness condition. The soil moisture analysis rainfall tool (SMART) is used to correct a near real-time satellite rainfall product (forcing correction scheme) and an ensemble Kalman filter is used to correct the PDM soil moisture state (state correction scheme). These two schemes are combined in a dual correction scheme and we assess the relative improvements of each. Our results demonstrate that the quality of the satellite rainfall product is improved by SMART during moderate-to-high daily rainfall events, which in turn leads to improved streamflow prediction during high flows. When employed individually, the soil moisture state correction scheme generally outperforms the rainfall correction scheme, especially for low flows. Overall, the combined dual correction scheme further improves the streamflow predictions (reduction in root mean square error and false alarm ratio, and increase in correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency). Our results provide new evidence of the value of satellite soil moisture observations within data-scarce regions. We also identify a number of challenges and limitations within the schemes.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1823-8;551-571;vol.41 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

We developed a well-replicated tree-ring chronology from Nothofagus pumilio near treeline in a high precipitation climate on Choshuenco Volcano (40°S) in Chile to examine: (a) variation in tree radial growth in relation to interannual climatic variability; and (b) relationships of radial growth to variability in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) at interannual and decadal time scales. A tree-ring chronology based on 99 tree-ring series from 80 N. pumilio trees near treeline showed a high series intercorrelation (0.48) indicating a strong common environmental signal. Radial growth is negatively correlated with precipitation in late spring (November-December). Temperature and tree growth are positively correlated during late spring and early summer (November-January). Interannual variability in both seasonal climate and in tree growth is strongly teleconnected to ENSO and AAO variability. Radial growth of N. pumilio in this humid high-elevation forest does not show a positive trend over the past half century as predicted from global treeline theory and broadscale warming in the Patagonian-Andean region. Instead, tree growth increased sharply from the 1960s to a peak in the early 1980s but subsequently declined for c. 30years to its lowest level in >100years. The shift to higher radial growth after c. 1976 coincides with a shift towards warmer sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific which in turn are associated with warmer growing season temperatures. The decline in tree growth since the mid-1990s is coincident with the increasingly positive phase of the AAO and high spring precipitation periods associated with El Niño conditions. The recent shift towards reduced growth of N. pumilio at this humid high-elevation site coincident with rising AAO mirrors the reduced tree growth beginning in the 1960s for trees growing in relatively xeric, lower elevation sites throughout the Patagonian-Andean region. The current study indicates that N. pumilio growth response in humid high-elevation environments to recent broad-scale warming has been non-linear, and that AAO and ENSO are key climatic forcings of tree growth variability.";http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/2710;359-391;vol.40 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

The Latin America–Caribbean (LAC) region shares common history, culture, and socioeconomic issues but, at the same time, it is highly diverse in its physical and human geography. The LAC region is unique because approximately 80% of its population lives in urban areas, resulting in high-density hotspots of urbanization and vast unpopulated rural areas. In recent years, most countries of the region have experienced rapid growth in population and industrialization as their economies emerge. The rapid urbanization, the associated increases in mobile and industrial sources, and the growth of the agricultural activities related to biomass burning have degraded air quality in certain areas of the LAC region. Air pollution has negative implications for human health, ecosystems, and climate. In addition, air pollution and the warming caused by greenhouse gases could impact the melting of Andean glaciers, an important source of freshwater. To better understand the links between air pollution and climate, it is necessary to increase the number of atmospheric scientists and improve our observational, analytical, and modeling capacities. This requires sustained and prioritized funding as well as stronger collaboration within the LAC region.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00584.1;5782-5809;vol.26 is.16;Thomson Reuters ISI

These changes are related to the combination of the global sea surface temperature (SST) warming mode, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the westward shift of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), and the enhancement of Pacific South American and Pacific North American wave train patterns, which induces variations of the regional circulation at interannual and decadal scales. The joint contributions from these forcing factors are associated with a stronger and more equatorward regional Hadley cell, which enhances convergence towards the equator, strengthening and possibly delaying the retreat of the tropical part of the NAM. This in turn accelerates the demise of the northern NAM and delays the reversal of the cross-equatorial flow over South America, reducing moisture transport to the SAM and delaying its onset. In addition, the thermodynamic response to warming appears to cause local drier land conditions over both regions, reinforcing the observed changes in these monsoons. Although previous studies have identified the isolated influence of the regional Hadley cell, ENSO, AMO, global SST warming, and NASH on the NAM, the correlated changes between NAM and SAM through variations of the cross-equatorial flow had not been established before.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377026513000699;64-85;vol.65;Thomson Reuters ISI

First, the highest surface air temperature ever recorded in Santiago (with reliable records dating to 1877), 36.8°C at Quinta Normal, was measured at 15:47 local time on 20 March 2015. Immediately following this high heat event, an extreme precipitation event, with damaging streamflows from precipitation totals greater than 45 mm, occurred in the semiarid and hyperarid Atacama regions. Finally, concurrent with the heavy precipitation event, extremely warm temperatures were recorded throughout southern Chile. These events were examined from a synoptic perspective with the goal of identifying forcing mechanisms and potential interaction between each analysis which provides operational context by which to identify and predict similar events in the future. Primary findings were as follows: (1) record warm temperatures in central Chile resulted from anomalous lower troposphere ridging and easterly downslope flow, both of which developed in response to an anomalous midtroposphere ridge-trough pattern; (2) a cutoff low with anomalous heights near one standard deviation below normal slowly moved east and was steered ashore near 25°S by circulation around a very strong ridge (anomalies more than 3 standard deviations above normal) centered near 60°S; (3) anomalously high precipitable water content (20 mm above climatological norms) over the Peruvian Bight region was advected southward and eastward ahead of the cutoff low by low-level northwesterly flow, greatly enhancing observed precipitation over northern Chile.";http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n5/full/ngeo1797.html;339-346;vol.6 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

This analysis allows a comparison between the impact of the long term climate variations associated with insolation changes and the more recent effects of anthropogenic forcing on the region. The PMIP3 multimodel experiments suggest that changes in precipitation over almost all southern South America between MH and pre-industrial (PI) times due to insolation variations are significantly larger than those between PI and the present, which are due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Anthropogenic forcing has been particularly intense over western Patagonia inducing reduction of precipitation in summer, autumn and winter as a consequence of progressively weaker westerly winds over the region, which have moved further poleward, between ca. 35–55°S and have become stronger south of about 50°S. Orbital variations between the MH to the PI period increased insolation over southern South America during summer and autumn inducing warmer conditions in the PI, accentuated by the effect of anthropogenic forcing during the last century. On the other hand, changes in orbital parameters from the MH to the PI period reduced insolation during winter and spring inducing colder conditions, which have been reversed by the anthropogenic forcing.;http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/DPM-07-2013-0130;252-270;vol.23 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario. We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends, the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy - savannah-prone - dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the â € model democracy'view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.;http://www.aaqr.org/Doi.php?id=2_AAQR-13-03-OA-0082&v=14&i=3&m=4&y=2014;596-607;vol.14 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

A precipitation decline, of consistent direction but of larger amplitude than obtained in simulations with historical climate forcing, has been observed in central Chile since the late 1970s. To attribute the causes of this trend, we analyze local rain gauge data and contrast them to a large ensemble of both fully coupled and sea surface temperature-forced simulations. We show that in concomitance with large-scale circulation changes, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation explains about half of the precipitation trend observed in central Chile. The remaining fraction is unlikely to be driven exclusively by natural phenomena but rather consistent with the simulated regional effect of anthropogenic climate change. We particularly estimate that a quarter of the rainfall deficit affecting this region since 2010 is of anthropogenic origin. An increased persistence and recurrence of droughts in central Chile emerges then as a realistic scenario under the current socioeconomic pathway.;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063956;art63956;vol.8 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

The results show that there are more differences in responses by type of actor than between regions, where issues of national interest, such as ‘education-information’ and ‘preparedness’, are highlighted over others.

Nonetheless, an extreme precipitation event affected the region on 24-26 March 2015 with 1-day accumulated precipitation exceeding 40 mm in several locations and hourly mean rainfall rates higher than 10 mm h−1, producing floods and resulting in casualties and significant damage. The event is analyzed using ERA-Interim reanalysis, surface station data, sounding observations and satellite based radar. Two main conditions favorable for precipitation were present at the time of the event: (i) a cut-off low (COL) off the coast of Northern Chile and (ii) positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the eastern tropical Pacific. The circulation driven by the COL was strong but not extraordinary. A regional climate model (RegCM4) is used to test the sensitivity of precipitation to SST anomalies by removing the warm SST anomaly in the eastern tropical Pacific. The cooler simulation produced a very similar COL dry dynamics than that simulated in a control run (with observed SST), but, suppressed the precipitation by 60-80% over Northern Chile and 100% in parts of the Atacama Desert due to the decreased availability of precipitable water. The results indicate that the warm SST anomaly over eastern Pacific, favored by the onset of El Niño 2015-2016, was instrumental to the extreme precipitation event by providing an anomalous source of water vapor transported to Atacama by the circulation ahead of the COL.;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/full/ngeo1832.html;579-584;vol.6 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

The data include daily time series of surface runoff and sub-surface runoff outputs of 2 global climate models (GCMs) (the SRES A1B scenario simulation of ECHAM5/MPIOM and the RCP 4.5 scenario simulation of MPI-ESM-LR) and the dynamically downscaled outputs of ECHAM5/MPIOM and NCAR-CCSM3 scenario (SRES A1FI, A2 and B1) simulations. The suite of simulations enables a comprehensive analysis of the projected river discharge, and allows a comparison between CMIP5 simulations of MPI-ESM-LR and CMIP3 results from its predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM on a basin scale. We demonstrate that HD simulations forced with relatively low-resolution GCM outputs are not good at reproducing the seasonal cycle of discharge, which is typically characterized by less flow in the peak season and an earlier peak in annual discharge. Simulations forced with the MPI-ESM-LR yield more robust information on the annual cycle and timing of the annual peak discharge than ECHAM5-forced simulations. In contrast to GCM-forced simulations, high-resolution RCM-forced simulations reproduce the annual cycle of discharge reasonably well; however, overestimation of discharge during the cold season and bias in the timing of springtime snowmelt peaks persist in the RCM-forced simulations. Different RCM-forced scenario simulations indicate substantial decreases in mean annual discharge for the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers by the end of the century, ranging from 19-58%. Significant temporal shifts to earlier days (3-5 wk by the end of the 21st century) in the center time of the discharges are also projected for these rivers.

In this study we examine the climatic forcing of glacier response in the MH by evaluating modelled glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) and climatic conditions during the MH compared with pre-industrial time (PI, year 1750). We focus on the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, specifically Patagonia and the South Island of New Zealand. Climate conditions for the MH were obtained from PMIP2 model simulations, which in turn were used to force a simple glacier mass balance model to simulate changes in ELA. In Patagonia, the models simulate colder conditions during the MH in austral summer (-0.2 °C), autumn (-0.5 °C), and winter (-0.4), and warmer temperatures (0.2 °C) during spring. In the Southern Alps the models show colder MH conditions in autumn (-0.7 °C) and winter (-0.4 °C), warmer conditions in spring (0.3 °C), and no significant change in summer temperature. Precipitation does not show significant changes but exhibits a seasonal shift, with less precipitation from April to September and more precipitation from October to April during the MH in both regions. The mass balance model simulates a climatic ELA that is 15-33 m lower during the MH compared with PI conditions. We suggest that the main causes of this difference are driven mainly by colder temperatures associated with the MH simulation. Differences in temperature have a dual effect on glacier mass balance: (i) less energy is available for ablation during summer and early autumn and (ii) lower temperatures cause more precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain in late autumn and winter, resulting in more accumulation and higher surface albedo. For these reasons, we postulate that the modelled ELA changes, although small, may help to explain larger glacier extents observed by 6000 years BP in South America and New Zealand.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/palo.20047/abstract;607-618;vol.28 is.4;Thomson Reuters ISI

In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloé Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 ± 0.77 kg C m−2, which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/aec.12054;158-169;vol.39 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

Dendrochronological samples were collected as cross sections and increment cores by using a chainsaw and increment borers, respectively. Total ring-width chronologies were developed for each site. Principal component analyses (PCA) were used to identify common temperature, precipitation and tree growth variation patterns. Correlation and response function analyses between chronologies and records of temperature and precipitation were used to evaluate the relation of climate variables on tree growth. The months during which tree growth was most strongly affected by precipitation were January, February and October from the previous year; only the temperature of September from the previous year affected the tree growth. In some chronologies, May’s average monthly maximum temperature was negatively correlated with tree growth. PCA and a comparison of PCA factor scores of climatic variables and chronologies showed no significant differences between northern, central or southern portions of the MBBR. Apparently, tree growth in the MBBR is reduced in years of low January–May precipitation combined with high summer (September of the previous year) temperatures, a scenario which is likely to occur as a consequence of global climate change.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-013-9958-x;329-344;vol.29 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, the origin of these maxima, and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in N2O cycling, remains unclear. In order to gain insight into the importance of denitrification and factors regulating N2O cycling at upper oxyclines in the eastern South Pacific, the production and consumption of N2O by denitrification were measured using a classical acetylene method under induced anoxia with the addition of an electron acceptor (nitrite) and donors (sodium acetate and glucose). The results indicated that decreased O2 clearly affected the ratio in which N2O is reduced to N2 at the midoxycline (∼40 m depth) and at the oxycline’s base (∼80 m depth). Under induced anoxia, higherN2Oproduction (fromNO− 2 toN2Oof 67.2 nM d−1) occurred at 40mdepth, with half of the total quantity being consumed by denitrification (from N2OtoN2 of 32 nM d−1); conversely,100%of theN2Owas reduced toN2 at 80mdepth. In comparison with previously reported results at the base of the oxycline at an offshore station, the addition ofNO− 2 (as sodium nitrite) along with dissolved organic carbon (as sodium acetate and glucose) doubled the net N2O production by denitrification (∼20 nM d−1).

This area is characterized by its high altitude, prevalent cloudless conditions and relatively low columns of ozone and water vapor. Aimed at the characterization of the solar spectrum in the Atacama Desert, we carried out in February-March 2015 ground-based measurements of the spectral irradiance (from the ultraviolet to the near infrared) at seven locations that ranged from the city of Antofagasta (on the southern pacific coastline) to the Chajnantor Plateau (5,100 m altitude). Our spectral measurements allowed us to retrieve the total ozone column, the precipitable water, and the aerosol properties at each location. We found that changes in these parameters, as well as the shorter optical path length at high-altitude locations, lead to significant increases in the surface irradiance with the altitude. Our measurements show that, in the range 0–5100 m altitude, surface irradiance increases with the altitude by about 27% in the infrared range, 6% in the visible range, and 20% in the ultraviolet range.

Urban regions located upstream of high mountains, such as the Andes, can potentially impact the cryosphere by deposition of particles onto the surface of the snowpack and glaciers.     Santiago, the capital of Chile, has more than 6 million inhabitants and regularly experiences episodes of severe pollution, particularly during the austral winter. Some studies have hypothesized that particle pollution from Santiago can reach the cryosphere downwind of the city, but the scarcity of measurements made high in the mountains prevents the validation of mesoscale models so the proof of actual impact remains elusive. A research project was designed to provide some insight into this question. The Pollution Impact on Snow in the Cordillera - Experiments and Simulations (PISCES) project was carried out in 2014 and includes both observational and modeling components. A five-week field campaign was conducted at the end of winter, at an elevated site in a mountain valley, 65 km to the southeast of the center of Santiago, to characterize some aspects of particulate pollution.     During synoptic conditions that result in clear days at the site, the mesoscale mountain-valley circulation is effective in transporting pollutants upwards during the day, leading to diluted particle concentrations beyond the summits of the highest peaks. Cloudy days with reduced up-valley circulation do not show increased concentrations associated with transport. Back trajectories indicate that airmasses reaching the site during the field campaign are seldom influenced by pollution from Santiago.;http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/3409/2013/;3409-3422;vol.13 is.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

Some of these eddies exhibit subsurface hypoxic or suboxic conditions and may serve as important hotspots for nitrogen loss, but little is known about oxygen consumption rates and nitrogen transformation processes associated with these eddies. In the austral fall of 2011, during the Tara Oceans expedition, an intrathermocline, anticyclonic, mesoscale eddy with a suboxic (< 2 µmol kg−1 of O2), subsurface layer (200–400 m) was detected  ∼  900 km off the Chilean shore (30° S, 81° W). The core of the eddy's suboxic layer had a temperature-salinity signature characteristic of Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW) that at this latitude is normally restricted to an area near the coast. Measurements of nitrogen species within the eddy revealed undersaturation (below 44 %) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite accumulation (> 0.5 µM), suggesting that active denitrification occurred in this water mass. Using satellite altimetry, we were able to track the eddy back to its region of formation on the coast of central Chile (36.1° S, 74.6° W). Field studies conducted in Chilean shelf waters close to the time of eddy formation provided estimates of initial O2 and N2O concentrations of the ESSW source water in the eddy. By the time of its offshore sighting, concentrations of both O2 and N2O in the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eddy were lower than concentrations in surrounding water and “source water” on the shelf, indicating that these chemical species were consumed as the eddy moved offshore. Estimates of apparent oxygen utilization rates at the OMZ of the eddy ranged from 0.29 to 44 nmol L−1 d−1 and the rate of N2O consumption was 3.92 nmol L−1 d−1. These results show that mesoscale eddies affect open-ocean biogeochemistry in the ESP not only by transporting physical and chemical properties from the coast to the ocean interior but also during advection, local biological consumption of oxygen within an eddy further generates conditions favorable to denitrification and loss of fixed nitrogen from the system.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jgrd.50293;2966-2980;vol.118 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

The oceans account for one-third of the global atmospheric N2O emissions, in which they are primarily cycled by nitrification and denitrification, with high N2O production in the subsurface waters. The surface waters are generally reported to be in equilibrium or slightly supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. However, surface N2O sub-saturations have been observed in several regions of the world's oceans, such as off south-central Chile, which is bathed by the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), where N2O subsaturations as low as 35% have been registered during the austral spring and summer. An analysis of the mechanisms driving such surface N2O subsaturations (physical or biological) showed that physical mechanisms were not responsible for the high surface N2O deficit. In contrast, in situ potential experiments in surface waters with 15N2O addition showed an active biological N2O fixation (between 0.43 and 87.34nmol/L/d), with the highest N2O fixation rates associated with the SAAW (25.25-25.75kg/m3).Additionally, incubation experiments with 15N2O in surface water samples from one oceanic station showed high 15N-POM enrichment (0.44‰) and an inhibition of 15N-POM enrichment when an additional nitrogen source was added (NO2 - and NH4 +). These results suggest the existence of a mechanism able to use several nitrogen sources, including N2O. Molecular analyses (16S rRNA gene) from these experiments showed the presence of three major groups of bacteria: Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria and Cyanobacteria, with Synechococcus sp. being the dominant group in the culture. However, the analysis of the nifH gene showed a taxonomic affiliation to the order Stigonematales associated with Mastigocladus sp. and Fischerella sp. and the order Oscillatoriales associated with Trichodesmium sp.Finally, the oceanic region exhibiting surface N2O subsaturations acts as a sink for atmospheric N2O, consuming ∼11.4 Gg of N2O in a six-month period. The N2O levels in the sink are 75% higher than those of the reported N2O source from the coastal band. The balance between the oceanic region and the coastal band results in a sink region of 4.94 Gg of N2O during this period.;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131108/ncomms3758/full/ncomms3758.html;art2758;vol.4;Thomson Reuters ISI

Consequently, methods for delineation, establishment and management of protected areas must consider the species' future distribution in response to future climate conditions. Biodiversity in high altitude semiarid regions may be particularly threatened by future climate change. In this study we assess the main environmental variables that best explain present day presence of the world's highest elevation woodlands in the South American Altiplano, and model how climate change may affect the future distribution of this unique ecosystem under different climate change scenarios. These woodlands are dominated by Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species that forms unique biological communities with important conservation value. Our results indicate that five environmental variables are responsible for 91% and 90.3% of the present and future P. tarapacana distribution models respectively, and suggest that at the end of the 21st century, there will be a significant reduction (56%) in the potential habitat for this species due to more arid conditions. Since it is predicted that P. tarapacana's potential distribution will be severely reduced in the future, we propose a new network of national protected areas across this species distribution range in order to insure the future conservation of this unique ecosystem. Based on an extensive literature review we identify research topics and recommendations for on-ground conservation and management of P. tarapacana woodlands.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001770;01/11/18;vol.30;Thomson Reuters ISI

Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578%) and CH4 (up to 6200%) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from-319 to 714mmolm-2d-1) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5mmolm-2d-1) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 μmol m-2 d-1. These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;http://epc.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/0263774X15614734;999-1019;vol.34 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological activity is mainly driven by water availability6, 7, 8. The increase in aridity predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide9, 10, 11 may therefore threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the availability of essential nutrients12, 13, 14. Here we evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition12, 13, 14. Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key services provided by these ecosystems.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84920986276&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;131-147;vol.62 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, it is largely unknown how these two major drivers of global change will simultaneously influence the N cycle in drylands, the largest terrestrial biome on the planet. We conducted a global observational study to evaluate how aridity and human impacts, together with biotic and abiotic factors, affect key soil variables of the N cycle. Location Two hundred and twenty-four dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica widely differing in their environmental conditions and human influence. Methods Using a standardized field survey, we measured aridity, human impacts (i.e. proxies of land uses and air pollution), key biophysical variables (i.e. soil pH and texture and total plant cover) and six important variables related to N cycling in soils: total N, organic N, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic:inorganic N and N mineralization rates. We used structural equation modelling to assess the direct and indirect effects of aridity, human impacts and key biophysical variables on the N cycle. Results Human impacts increased the concentration of total N, while aridity reduced it. The effects of aridity and human impacts on the N cycle were spatially disconnected, which may favour scarcity of N in the most arid areas and promote its accumulation in the least arid areas. Main conclusions We found that increasing aridity and anthropogenic pressure are spatially disconnected in drylands. This implies that while places with low aridity and high human impact accumulate N, most arid sites with the lowest human impacts lose N. Our analyses also provide evidence that both increasing aridity and human impacts may enhance the relative dominance of inorganic N in dryland soils, having a negative impact on key functions and services provided by these ecosystems.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661114002262;12-23;vol.137;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this study the spatio-temporal trends in the occurrence and area affected by fire in the Maule region during the period 1986-2012 were examined. We use the Corporación Nacional Forestal fire database, whose records were spatially represented by a grid of 2x2 km. The occurrence was stable during the analyzed period with an average of 378 events per year. The burned area presented three periods above average with 5.273 hectares per year. Most of the fires affected surfaces of less than 5 hectares, while a very small number of events explain most of the area annually burned in the region. According to the startup fuel, we found an increasing number of events initiated in forest plantations in contrast to the decreasing number of fires originated in the native forests. Causes of fires associated with transit and transportation were the most important. The number of events accidentally caused by burning waste significantly increased in the period studied. Most of the fires occurred in the coastal area and the central valley, strongly associated with the road network and the most populated cities. This work represents an important contribution to the characterization of forest fires in the region of Maule, being the first to represent the fire statistics in Chile in a spatially explicit way.;http://www.biogeosciences.net/12/1925/2015/;1925-1940;vol.12 is.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

Across a surface water transect spanning the sparsely studied tropical Indian Ocean, we examined  Synechococcus  and  Prochlorococcus  occurrence, taxonomy and habitat preference in an evolutionary context. Shotgun sequencing of size fractionated microbial communities from 0.1 μm to 20 μm and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicated that cyanobacteria account for up to 15% of annotated reads, with the genera  Prochlorococcus  and  Synechococcus  comprising 90% of the cyanobacterial reads, even in the largest size fraction (3.0–20 mm).

Habitat reconstructions coupled with phylogenetic analysis of the Indian Ocean samples suggested that large  Synechococcus -like ancestors in coastal waters expanded their ecological niche towards open oligotrophic waters in the Indian Ocean through lineage diversification and associated streamlining of genomes ( e . g . loss of phycobilisomes and acquisition of Chl  b ); resulting in contemporary small celled  Prochlorococcus .

Historical simulations start at 850 CE and continue through to 2005. The standard simulations include changes in forcing from solar luminosity, Earth's orbital configuration, CO2, additional greenhouse gases, land use, and sulphate and volcanic aerosols. In spite of very different modelled pre-industrial global surface air temperatures, overall 20th century trends in surface air temperature and carbon uptake are reasonably well simulated when compared to observed trends. Land carbon fluxes show much more variation between models than ocean carbon fluxes, and recent land fluxes appear to be slightly underestimated. It is possible that recent modelled climate trends or climate-carbon feedbacks are overestimated resulting in too much land carbon loss or that carbon uptake due to CO2 and/or nitrogen fertilization is underestimated. Several one thousand year long, idealized, 2 × and 4 × CO2 experiments are used to quantify standard model characteristics, including transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities, and climate-carbon feedbacks. The values from EMICs generally fall within the range given by general circulation models. Seven additional historical simulations, each including a single specified forcing, are used to assess the contributions of different climate forcings to the overall climate and carbon cycle response. The response of surface air temperature is the linear sum of the individual forcings, while the carbon cycle response shows a non-linear interaction between land-use change and CO2 forcings for some models. Finally, the preindustrial portions of the last millennium simulations are used to assess historical model carbon-climate feedbacks. Given the specified forcing, there is a tendency for the EMICs to underestimate the drop in surface air temperature and CO2 between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age estimated from palaeoclimate reconstructions. This in turn could be a result of unforced variability within the climate system, uncertainty in the reconstructions of temperature and CO2, errors in the reconstructions of forcing used to drive the models, or the incomplete representation of certain processes within the models. Given the forcing datasets used in this study, the models calculate significant land-use emissions over the pre-industrial period. This implies that land-use emissions might need to be taken into account, when making estimates of climate-carbon feedbacks from palaeoclimate reconstructions.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.2014.59.6.1865/abstract;1865-1878;vol.59 is.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

As a result, there are large uncertainties in the total emission flux of mineral dust, its natural variability at various timescales, and the possible contribution from anthropogenic land use changes. This work aims for estimating dust emissions and reduces their uncertainty over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula—the largest dust source region of the globe. We use a data assimilation approach to constrain dust emission fluxes at a monthly resolution for 18 subregions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-derived aerosol optical depth is assimilated in a regional configuration of a general circulation model coupled to an aerosol model. We describe this data assimilation system and apply it for 1 year, resulting in a total mineral dust emissions flux estimate of 2900 Tg yr−1 over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula for the year 2006.

We compare 11 years of AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with in situ particulate matter mass concentrations (PM). MODIS AOD reaches its maximum in summer and minimum in winter, the opposite of the annual cycle of surface PM. To improve our understanding of the relevant governing processes, we use a simple model that estimates the boundary layer (BL) AOD based on measured PM, relative humidity and BL height (BLH) as well as best estimates of aerosol composition, size distribution, and optical properties. Model results indicate that a weak annual AOD cycle is due to the opposite annual cycles in BLH and PM, which is largely supported by the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data collected in 2001 and 2002 in Santiago. We identify a possible bias linked to the operational estimate of surface reflectance that may lead to a spurious summer maximum in MODIS AOD over Santiago. This misfit in surface reflectance appears to affect not only Santiago but also a significant area of the semi-arid Southern South America. Sensitivity experiments with the simple model indicate an underestimate of simulated AOD as compared to AERONET data. This underestimate points to the possible role of residual aerosol layers in the AOD measured at the surface (not included in the simple model). Cirrus clouds appear not to play a significant role in explaining the MODIS AOD seasonality. The need for improved characterizations of aerosol properties and their temporal and spatial distribution in cities such as Santiago is emphasized.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214007496;4-14;vol.356;Thomson Reuters ISI

Oxygen, N2O, nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) showed clear seasonal variability associated with upwelling favorable winds (spring-summer) and also inter-annual variability, which in the case of N2O was clearly observed during the occurrence of N2O hotspots with saturation levels of up to 4849%. These hotspots consistently took place during the upwelling-favorable periods in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011, below the mixed layer (15-50 m depth) in waters with hypoxia and some accumulation. The N2O hotspots displayed excesses of N2O (ΔN2O) three times higher than the average monthly anomalies (2002-2012). Estimated relationships of ΔN2O versus apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and ΔN2O versus suggest that aerobic ammonium oxidation (AAO) and partial denitrification are the processes responsible for high N2O accumulation in subsurface water. Chl-a levels were reasonably correlated with the presence of the N2O hotspots, suggesting that microbial activities fuelled by high availability of organic matters lead to high N2O production. As a result, this causes a substantial N2O efflux into the atmosphere of up to 260 μmol m−2 d−1. The N2O hotspots are transient events or hot moments, which may occur more frequently than they are observed. If so, this upwelling area is producing and emitting greater than expected amounts of N2O and is therefore an important N2O source that should be considered in the global atmospheric N2O balance.";http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84901723947&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;5226-5239;vol.119 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

In the ocean, N2O is produced by microbiological processes such as nitrification and partial denitrification, which account for about a third of global emissions. Conversely, complete denitrification (the dissimilative reduction of N2O to N2) under suboxic/anoxic conditions is the only known pathway accountable for N2O consumption in the ocean. In this work, it is demonstrated that the biological assimilation of N2O could be a significant pathway capable of directly transforming this gas into particulate organic nitrogen (PON). N2O is shown to be biologically fixed within the subtropical and tropical waters of the eastern South Pacific Ocean, under a wide range of oceanographic conditions and at rates ranging from 2 pmol N L(-1) d(-) to 14.8 nmol N L(-1) d(-1) (mean ± SE of 0.522 ± 1.06 nmol N L(-1) d(-1), n = 93). Additional assays revealed that cultured cyanobacterial strains of Trichodesmium (H-9 and IMS 101), and Crocosphaera (W-8501) have the capacity to directly fix N2O under laboratory conditions; suggesting that marine photoautotrophic diazotrophs could be using N2O as a substrate. This metabolic capacity however was absent in Synechococcus (RCC 1029). The findings presented here indicate that assimilative N2O fixation takes place under extreme environmental conditions (i.e., light, nutrient, oxygen) where both autotrophic (including cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic microbes appear to be involved. This process could provide a globally significant sink for atmospheric N2O which in turn affects the oceanic N2O inventory and may also represent a yet unexplored global oceanic source of fixed N.";http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10980-014-9993-2;181-186;vol.29 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

The KPR is affected by an annual microalgal bloom caused by natural iron fertilization, and this may stimulate the microbes involved in GHG cycling. This study was carried out during the KEOPS 2 cruise during the austral spring of 2011. Oceanographic variables, including N2O and CH4, were sampled (from the surface to 500 m depth) in two transects along and across the KRP, the north-south (TNS) transect (46°-51° S, ∼ 72° E) and the east-west (TEW) transect (66°-75° E, ∼ 48.3° S), both associated with the presence of a plateau, polar front (PF) and other mesoscale features. The TEW presented N<inf>2</inf>O levels ranging from equilibrium (105%) to slightly supersaturated (120%) with respect to the atmosphere, whereas CH<inf>4</inf> levels fluctuated dramatically, being highly supersaturated (120-970%) in areas close to the coastal waters of the Kerguelen Islands and in the PF. The TNS showed a more homogenous distribution for both gases, with N<inf>2</inf>O and CH<inf>4</inf> levels ranging from 88 to 171% and 45 to 666% saturation, respectively. Surface CH4 peaked at southeastern stations of the KPR (A3 stations), where a phytoplankton bloom was observed. Both gases responded significantly, but in contrasting ways (CH<inf>4</inf> accumulation and N<inf>2</inf>O depletion), to the patchy distribution of chlorophyll a.

N<inf>2</inf> fixation in subsurface suboxic conditions (1.5 ± 1.16 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) also occurred mainly during late summer and autumn while virtually absent in winter.

N<inf>2</inf> fixation also showed a positive correlation with total chlorophyll and the C:N ratio of phytoplankton, but not to the P excess compared to N.

These data were combined with all available Mediterranean Lophelia and Madrepora ages compiled from literature to conduct a basin-wide assessment of the spatial and temporal occurrence of these prominent framework-forming scleractinian species in the Mediterranean realm and to unravel the palaeo-environmental conditions that controlled their proliferation or decline. For the first time special focus was placed on a closer examination of potential differences occurring between the eastern and western Mediterranean sub-basins. Our results clearly demonstrate that cold-water corals occurred sparsely in the entire Mediterranean during the last glacial before becoming abundant during the Bølling-Allerød warm interval, pointing to a basin-wide, almost concurrent onset in (re-)colonisation after ∼13.5. ka. This time coincides with a peak in meltwater discharge originating from the northern Mediterranean borderlands which caused a major reorganisation of the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. During the Younger Dryas and Holocene, some striking differences in coral proliferation were identified between the sub-basins such as periods of highly prolific coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Younger Dryas and in the western basin during the Early Holocene, whereas a temporary pronounced coral decline during the Younger Dryas was exclusively affecting coral sites in the Alboran Sea. Comparison with environmental and oceanographic data revealed that the proliferation of the Mediterranean corals is linked with enhanced productivity conditions. Moreover, corals thrived in intermediate depths and showed a close relationship with intermediate water mass circulation in the Mediterranean sub-basins. For instance, reduced Levantine Intermediate Water formation hampered coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during sapropel S1 event as reduced Winter Intermediate Water formation did in the westernmost part of the Mediterranean (Alboran Sea) during the Mid-Holocene. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates the importance to consider region-specific environmental changes as well as species-specific environmental preferences in interpreting coral chronologies. Moreover, it highlights that the occurrence or decline of cold-water corals is not controlled by one key parameter but rather by a complex interplay of various environmental variables.;http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/439/1/247;247-255;vol.439 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined. The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/403;403-407;vol.343 is.6169;Thomson Reuters ISI

Considering this, we study this problem using CFD tools able to include the complex geometry characterizing it and the different processes affecting circulation: flow interaction with obstacles, buoyancy, stratification and turbulence. We performed simulations using a previously developed OpenFOAM solver, focusing in the particular case of Chuquicamata, a large open pit mine (∼1. km deep) located in northern Chile. Both idealized and real topographies were used. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used LES to incorporate it in the calculation, using a DES approach to solve the flow near walls.The results from the idealized cases support the idea that buoyant currents foster the exit of particles from the pit and increase the turbulence inside its atmosphere, modifying the purely mechanical recirculatory flow inside the cavity. Differences in the air circulation and dispersion of particles between idealized and non-idealized cases are reported. In particular, there are changes in the intensity and location of the recirculation inside the pit due to variations in the aspect ratio (length/depth) of the cavity along the axis perpendicular to the main flow. Also, the topography surrounding the mine affects the main flow that sweeps the cavity, channeling it along the main axis of the pit and forcing it to enter the cavity through the lower level of the top edge. As a consequence, the patterns of pollutant transport observed in the idealized cases, dominated by near-wall upward currents, are different than those observed in the cases with complex topography, where the dispersion is dominated by internal buoyant upward currents. Anyhow, whether by internal or near wall upward currents, in all buoyant cases considered a large percentage of the particles injected inside the pit leaves the cavity.Further experiments studying the effect of 3D aspect ratio over the mechanically forced internal flow are needed to fully understand the effect of the internal geometry of the pit over the flow. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169414010099;511-523;vol.529;Thomson Reuters ISI

We describe seasonal CH4 variation as well as potential mechanisms producing CH4 in surface waters of the central Chile upwelling ecosystem (36°S). Surface waters were always supersaturated in CH4 (from 125% up to 550%), showing a clear seasonal signal triggered by wind driven upwelling processes (austral spring-summer period), that matched with the periods of high chlorophyll-a and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) levels. Methane cycling experiments, with/without the addition of dimethylsulfide (including 13C-DMS) and acetylene (a nonspecific inhibitor of CH4 oxidation) along with monthly measurements of CH4, DMSP and other oceanographic variables revealed that DMS can be a CH4 precursor. Net CH4 cycling rates (control) fluctuated between -0.64 and 1.44nmolL-1d-1. After the addition of acetylene, CH4 cycling rates almost duplicated relative to the control, suggesting a strong methanotrophic activity. With a spike of DMS, the net CH4 cycling rate significantly increased relative to the acetylene and control treatment. Additionally, the δ13C values of CH4 at the end of the incubations (after addition of 13C enriched-DMS) were changed, reaching -32‰ PDB compared to natural values between -44‰ and -46‰ PDB. These findings indicate that, in spite of the strong CH4 consumption by methanotrophs, this upwelling area is an important source of CH4 to the atmosphere. The effluxes are derived partially from in situ surface production and seem to be related to DMSP/DMS metabolism. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945264768&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;1205-1217;vol.8 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

We characterize the temporal and vertical variability of anammox and denitrification over the continental shelf off central Chile (36.5°S), through 15N and 13C tracer experiments, including amendments with H2S and S2O2- 3 along with measurements of 15N2 and 15N2O production and oceanographic variables during a year (2009 to 2010). Restricted to the bottom waters, both anammox and denitrification contributed similarly (∼ 500 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) to N loss during spring, while a marked decrease in the activity of these processes occurred in summer (103 and 14 nmolN2 L-1 d-1 for anammox and denitrification, respectively). During fall, denitrification was the only contributor to the observed nitrogen deficit (894 nmol N2 L-1 d-1). Interestingly, a substantial increase in the rates of denitrification (∼ 1200 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) and dark 13C assimilation were observed after the addition of H2S, indicating an autotrophic contribution to denitrification, which could be fueled in situ by H2S emitted from sediments or produced in the water column. The observed patterns seem to be controlled (stimulated or inhibited) by the availability of oxygen, organic matter, andH2S. This study establishes the magnitude and co-occurrence of the different processes responsible for N removal in the coastal upwelling system of central Chile. This linkage of the nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles is relevant to a global climate change scenario.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84900314869&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;357-375;vol.95 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

Sedimentary δ15N records spanning the last deglaciation suggest marked shifts in the nitrogen cycle during this time, but the quantification of these changes has been hinderedby the complexity of nitrogen isotope cycling. Herewe present a database of δ15Nin sediments throughout the world’s oceans, including 2,329 modern seafloor samples, and 76 timeseries spanning the past 30,000 years. We showthat the δ15Nvalues of modern seafloor sediments are consistent with values predicted by our knowledge of nitrogen cycling in thewater column. Despite many local deglacial changes, the globally averaged δ15N values of sinking organic matter were similar during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene. Considering the global isotopic mass balance, we explain these observations with the following deglacial history of nitrogen inventory processes. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the nitrogen cycle was near steady state. During the deglaciation, denitrification in the pelagic water column accelerated. The flooding of continental shelves subsequently increased denitrification at the seafloor, and denitrification reached near steady-state conditions again in the Early Holocene.We use a recent parameterization of seafloor denitrification to estimate a 30-120% increase in benthic denitrification between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago. Based on the similarity of globally averaged δ15N values during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene, we infer that pelagic denitrification must have increased by a similar amount between the two steady states.;http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature13196 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784218;76-80;vol.509 is.7498;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this work, we analyse 260 soundings compiled over the period 1994–2014, and make the data available for the international community. We characterise O3 profiles over this remote area of the Pacific by means of statistical analyses that consider, on the one hand, a traditional climatology that describes the data in terms of seasonal cycles based on monthly averages and, on the other hand, a process-oriented analysis based on self-organising maps. Our analyses show the influence of both tropical and subtropical/mid-latitude air masses at Rapa Nui. The former occurs in summer and fall when convective conditions prevail, and the latter in late winter and spring when subsiding conditions are recurrent. The occurrence of stratospheric intrusions in late winter and spring in connection with deep troughs and the presence of the subtropical jet stream is also apparent in the data set. The tropospheric ozone column is in good agreement with the corresponding data derived from satellites but with a systematic overestimate of summer and fall values. There is evidence of an upward trend in ozone near the surface, which suggests the impact of local pollution. We look forward to an enhancement of the Rapa Nui observing site, given its location that offers a privileged position to observe climate change over the sparsely sampled and vast South Pacific Ocean.;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140710/ncomms5375/full/ncomms5375.html;art4375;vol.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

We calibrated the HYDRUS-1D model against measurements of the soil moisture profile within seven contrasted sites, we validated HYDRUS-1D simulations against ET estimates derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements within two contrasted sites, and we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the HYDRUS-1D ET simulations throughout almost two growth cycles for the seven sites. The calibration of HYDRUS-1D was correctly achieved, with a relative RMSE of 20% on average. Validation of HYDRUS-1D simulations against EC measurements was satisfactory, with RMSE values of about 40 W m−2 at the hourly timescale and 0.5 mm d−1 at the daily timescale. HYDRUS-1D was able to provide consistent time series of ET within the seven contrasted sites and throughout the two growth cycles. We conclude that HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used as an alternative to EC measurements within rainfed vineyards, to alleviate experimental efforts for device cost and maintenance. Further, HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used for characterizing spatial variabilities and temporal dynamics, assessing impact of pedological conditions and land use on ET, or validating remote sensing retrievals over regional extents.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X14000077;90-101;vol.40;Thomson Reuters ISI

These conditions are particularly harsh in the tropics, where the highest elevation treelines occur. In this environment the maintenance of a positive carbon balance involves protecting the photosynthetic apparatus and taking advantage of any climatically favorable periods. To characterize photoprotective mechanisms at such high elevations, and particularly to address the question of whether these mechanisms are the same as those previously described in woody plants along extratropical treelines, we have studied photosynthetic responses in Polylepis tarapacana in the central Andes (18 °S) along an elevational gradient from 4,300 to 4,900 m. For comparative purposes this gradient has been complemented with a lower elevation site (3,700 m) where another Polylepis species (P. rugulosa) occurs. During the daily cycle, two periods of photosynthetic activity were observed: one during the morning when, despite low temperatures, assimilation was high; and the second starting at noon when the stomata closed because of a rise in the vapor pressure deficit and thermal dissipation is prevalent over photosynthesis. From dawn to noon there was a decrease in the content of antenna pigments (chlorophyll b and neoxanthin), together with an increase in the content of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. These results could be caused by a reduction in the antenna size along with an increase in photo-protection. Additionally, photo-protection was enhanced by a partial overnight retention of de-epoxised xanthophylls. The unique combination of all of these mechanisms made possible the efficient use of the favorable conditions during the morning while still providing enough protection for the rest of the day. This strategy differs completely from that of extratropical mountain trees, which uncouple light-harvesting and energy-use during long periods of unfavorable, winter conditions.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379114000705;143-157;vol.90;Thomson Reuters ISI

Precipitation is concentrated in austral winter, mostly associated with the passage of cold fronts. The freezing level over central Chile is typically between 1500 and 2500m when precipitation is present. In about a third of the cases, however, precipitation occurs accompanied by warm temperatures and freezing levels above 3000 m, leading to a sizeable increment in the pluvial area of Andean basins and setting the stage for hydrometeorological hazards. Here, warm winter storms in central Chile are studied, including a statistical description of their occurrence and an estimate of their hydrological impacts. Remote-sensed data and high-resolution reanalysis are used to explore the synoptic-scale environment of a typical case, generalized later by a compositing analysis. The structure of warm storms is also contrasted with that of the more recurrent cold cases. Precipitation during warm events occurs in the warm sector of a slow-moving cold front because of the intense moisture flux against the mountains in connection with a land-falling atmospheric river. This is in turn driven by a strong zonal jet aloft and reduced mechanical blocking upstream of the Andes. On a broader scale, a key element is the presence of a slowly moving anticyclone over the south Pacific, fostering advection of cold air intomidlatitudes. The intense and persistent zonal jet stretches a moist-air corridor from the central Pacific to the west coast of South America. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397513001331 http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84893420542&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;224-235;vol.42;Thomson Reuters ISI

Mean precipitation between 900 and 1200 mm yr−1 is observed in the surrounding lowland, but river flow measurements suggest values ≥3000 mm yr−1 atop the mountains. To verify and characterize such marked orographic enhancement, 15 rain gauges were deployed around and over the NM. The observations were supplemented by a high-resolution WRF simulation and linear theory (LT) modeling during the winter of 2011. The estimated mean precipitation increases gradually from offshore (~1000 mm yr−1) to the north-facing foothills (2000 mm yr−1). The precipitation rapidly increases in the upslope sector to reach ~4000 mm yr−1 over the northern half of the NM elevated plateau, and decreases farther south to reach background values 20–30 km downstream of the mountains. The upstream (downstream) orographic enhancement (suppression) was relatively uniform among storms when considering event accumulations but varied substantially within each storm, with larger modifications during pre- and postfrontal stages and minor modifications during the brief but intense frontal passage. WRF results are in good agreement with observations in terms of seasonal and daily mean rainfall distributions, as well as temporal variability. Given its linear, steady-state formulation, the LT model cannot resolve rainfall variability at short (hourly) time scales, which in WRF is at least characterized by transient, mesoscale rainbands. Nonetheless, the rainbands are mobile so the accumulation field at monthly or longer time scales produced by the linear model is remarkably similar to its WRF counterpart.;http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0717-92002014000300001&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en;257-267;vol.35 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

This region extends from ∼40°S to 55°S along the west coast of South America, is limited to the east by the austral Andes, and features a hyper-humid, maritime climate. Stroke density exhibits a sharp maximum along the coast of southern Chile. Although precipitation there is largely produced by cold nimbostratus, days with more than one stroke occur up to a third of the time somewhere along the coastal strip. Disperse strokes are also observed off southern Chile. In contrast, strokes are virtually nonexistent over the austral Andes - where precipitation is maximum - and farther east over the dry lowlands of Argentina. Atmospheric reanalysis and satellite imagery are used to characterize the synoptic environment of lightning-producing storms, exemplified by a case study and generalized by a compositing analysis. Lightning activity tends to occur when Western Patagonia is immersed in a pool of cold air behind a front that has reached the coast at ∼40°S. Under these circumstances, midlevel cooling occurs before and is more prominent than near-surface cooling, leading to a weakly unstable postfrontal condition. Forced uplift of the strong westerlies impinging on the coastal mountains can trigger convection and produces significant lightning activity in this zone. Farther offshore, large-scale ascent near the cyclone's center may lift near-surface air parcels, fostering shallow convection and dispersing lightning activity.

Precipitation over this region is mostly produced by disturbances embedded in the westerly flow and is strongly modified by the austral Andes. Uplift on the windward side leads to hyperhumid conditions along the Pacific coast and the western slope of the Andes; in contrast, downslope subsidence dries the eastern plains leading to arid, highly evaporative conditions.The authors investigate the dependence of Patagonia’s local climate (precipitation and near-surface air temperature) year-to-year variability on large-scale circulation anomalies using results from a 30-yr-long high-resolution numerical simulation. Variations of the low-level zonal wind account for a large fraction of the rainfall variability at synoptic and interannual time scales. Zonal wind also controls the amplitude of the air temperature annual cycle by changing the intensity of the seasonally varying temperature advection.The main modes of year-to-year variability of the zonal flow over southern South America are also investigated. Year round there is a dipole between mid- and high latitudes. The node separating wind anomalies of opposite sign migrates through the seasons, leading to a dipole over Patagonia during austral summer and a monopole during winter.

One approach is to use the distribution of summed radiocarbon-age probabilities to infer long-term population dynamics (i.e. palaeodemography). However, these can often be biased by preservation potential, site taphonomy or researcher priorities among other aspects, all of which require large datasets to resolve adequately. For this report, we have created such a dataset for the South-Central Andes (16°-25°S), here termed the South Central Andes Radiocarbon (SCAR) database. SCAR spans the last 15,000 years and incorporates ∼1700 14C-dates from 519 archeological sites reported across an extreme bioclimatic gradient that includes the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert and adjacent cold, high-elevation Altiplano. Among the possible methodological biases, we first evaluated those related to calibration procedures. Otherwise, changes in summed probability curves show no other relevant biases except for possible research interest/priorities that could be responsible for the gaps in the record from the Bolivian altiplano. Our temporally continuous time-series indicates that prehispanic populations exhibited significant demographic changes during the last 13,100calBP. Except for coastal populations; most regions show strongly coordinated demographic fluctuations that follow the same major patterns. Thus, we identified two broad scale population events across the South-Central Andes (Atacama inland, Bolivian Altiplano) from 13,100-4000calBP and then from 4000calBP to the present. In contrast, the Atacama coastal records suggest a different and more variable occupation pattern over the last 13,460calBP, which could be driven by the interaction with oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling). A widespread major decline at 700calBP clearly predates the Spanish colonization and occurs in all of our regions. This widespread decline does not appear to be due to methodological biases, and suggests that a population crash occurred before European occupation. Overall, the SCAR database constitutes a valuable proxy for establishing the long-term dynamics of prehistoric societies that inhabited the western Andean slope. Time-series analyses that use SCAR will shed new light on the demographic and cultural dynamics at different spatial-scales, and help clarify the processes involved in the migrational trajectories and cultural evolution of the peoples that inhabited the South-Central Andes over the last 15,000 years.";http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84939260935&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;2307-2319;vol.41 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

We related seed trait values with fitness responses (germination and survival) after exposure to heat-shock and smoke experimental treatments on seeds from 10  H .  aromaticum  wild populations. We performed a phenotypic selection experiment to examine the relationship of seed traits with post-treatment fitness within a population (adaptive hypothesis). We then explored whether fire frequency in natural habitats was associated with trait expression across populations, and with germination and survival responses to experimental fire-cues. We found that populations subjected to higher fire frequency had, in average, more rounded and pubescent seeds than populations from rarely burned areas. Populations with more rounded and pubescent seeds were more resistant to 80°C heat-shock and smoke treatments.There was correlated selection on seed traits: pubescent-rounded or glabrouscent-elongated seeds had the highest probability of germinating after heat-shock treatments. Seed pubescence and shape in  H .  aromaticum  are heritable traits that modulate adaptive responses to fire. Our results provide new insights into the process of plant adaptation to fire and highlight the relevance of human-made fires as a strong evolutionary agent in the Anthropocene.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00259.1;1074-1092;vol.142 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

The objectives of the study were to determine main tree-fall gap attributes and to assess tree recruitment and growth patterns in tree-fall gaps of two mid-elevation Andean old-growth forests. We measured the canopy and expanded area of each gap, and for the gap-maker species we measured its diameter at breast height (dbh), felling direction and type of treefall. In each gap, tree seedlings, saplings and bamboo culms were counted in subplots. Increment cores of potential successors were obtained to examine growth patterns. There was a larger area in canopy gaps in NF than in STF (25.8 vs. 11.9 %). Expanded gaps were on average larger in NF than in STF (547 vs. 440 m2 ). Most gaps were originated by wind-snap and upturned root-plates of all the major tree species (Laureliopsis philippiana, Saxegothaea conspicua and Dasyphyllum diacanthoides, and Nothofagus dombeyi in NF). The understory species Chusquea culeou was an important competitor in gaps, especially in STF where the bamboo was more effective inhibiting the recruitment of tree seedlings. The successful recruitment of shade-tolerant tree species beneath endogenous tree-fall gaps indicates that these species follow a gap-phase regeneration mode through which -after several growth releases- they can reach the main canopy. These studies could offer valuable insights for the urgently required restoration and management of Andean old-growth forests.;http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ismej.2015.63 http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84942191029&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;2290-2303;vol.9 is.10;Thomson Reuters ISI

In south-central Chile, second-growth forests include those dominated by Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , Drimys winteri , and a mixture of evergreen species, especially hardwoods. This article examines the influence of fire and logging on the establishment patterns and development of second-growth forests in south-central Chile. We characterize the size structure and composition of these four types of forests with sampling plots. The identification of the type of disturbance and its date of occurrence was determined from evidence such as fire scars and even-aged pulses of tree establishment. The size, structure and species composition of these forests indicate an intermediate state of development with an average density and basal area ranging from 1294 to 5038 trees ha -1 and from 59 to 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectively. Logging and/or devastating fires that occurred in the early decades of the 1900s promoted the relatively rapid establishment and growth of pioneer species ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). In the Mixed Evergreen second-growth forests, mid-shade or shade tolerant species (e.g., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia, Amomyrtus luma, and A. meli ) became established mostly through vegetative sprouting. Fires and logging have been pervasive factors in determining the structural and compositional uniformity of the native forests of south-central Chile. Ecological restoration at a landscape level, either by ecological processes (i.e., a reduction in fire frequency) and/or the structure and composition of second-growth forests, provide a relevant approach to accelerating the generation of attributes of old-growth forests, therefore meeting manifold societal demands for forest goods and services. Los bosques secundarios representan el mayor recurso forestal para el manejo y la restauración de gran escala en muchas regiones del mundo. En el centro-sur de Chile los bosques secundarios están dominados por Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , D. winteri , y Siempreverde mixtos. El presente artículo examina la influencia del fuego y tala en los patrones de establecimiento y desarrollo de bosques secundarios de la región centro-sur de Chile. Para la caracterización de la estructura y composición de cada bosque secundario se seleccionaron rodales representativos estableciendo 4-6 parcelas de 900 m 2 . El tipo de disturbio y su fecha de ocurrencia fue establecido a través de evidencias tales como cicatrices de fuego y pulsos de establecimiento de árboles. La estructura de tamaños y composición indican un estado de desarrollo intermedio o de reiniciación del sotobosque presentando en promedio una densidad y área basal que varía entre 1294 y 5038 árboles ha -1 y entre 59 y 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectivamente. Incendios de gran severidad y/o madereo ocurridos en las primeras décadas de los 1900 promovieron un rápido establecimiento de las principales especies pioneras ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). En los bosques secundarios Siempreverde mixtos, el establecimiento de especies tolerantes o semi-tolerantes a la sombra (ej., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia ), fue principalmente por rebrotes vegetativos. El fuego y madereo han sido agentes clave en determinar la uniformidad estructural y composicional de los bosques nativos del centro-sur de Chile. La restauración ecológica a escala de paisaje, tanto de procesos ecológicos (frecuencia incendios) como de la estructura y composición de los bosques secundarios, ofrece una relevante aproximación para acelerar la generación de atributos de bosques antiguos que satisfagan los múltiples bienes y servicios ecosistémicos demandados por la sociedad.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17477891.2015.1134427?journalCode=tenh20;58-73;vol.15 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Assessing and optimising the information content of a monitoring network is a non-trivial problem. Here, we introduce a methodology formulated in a variational framework using an air quality model to simulate the dispersion of carbon monoxide (CO) as a passive tracer at the city scale.Weaddress the specific case of adding or removing stations, and the more general situation of optimally distributing a given number of stations in a domain taking into account transport patterns and spatial factors such as population density and emission patterns.Weconsider three quality indicators: precision gain, information gain and degrees of freedom for a signal. These metrics are all functions of the singular values of the sensitivity matrix that links emissions and observations in the variational framework.Weillustrate the application of the methodology in the case of Santiago (33.58S, 70.58W, 500ma.s.l.), a city of ca. 7 million inhabitants with significant pollution levels. Wedeem information gain as the best of the above indicators for this case.Wethen quantify the actual evolution of Santiago’s network and compare it with the optimal configuration suggested by our methodology and with results previously obtained using a statistical approach. The application is restricted to diurnal and summer conditions, for which the dispersion model shows a good agreement with observations. The current method offers advantages in that it allows extending a network to include new sites, and it explicitly considers the effects of dispersion patterns, and desired weighting functions such as emission fluxes and population density. We find that Santiago’s air quality has improved two-fold since 1988, regarding CO under diurnal summer conditions. Still, according to our results, the current configuration could be improved by integrating more suburban stations in the southwest of the basin.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112715000201;112-121;vol.342;Thomson Reuters ISI

The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84947491620&partnerID=tZOtx3y1 http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00382-015-2533-1;3183-3203;vol.45 is.11-12;Thomson Reuters ISI

We assessed the capacity of the models to predict the evolution of the dust cloud with lead times of up to 72 h using observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and dust surface concentrations from a ground-based measurement network. In addition, the predicted vertical dust distribution was evaluated with vertical extinction profiles from the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). To assess the diversity in forecast capability among the models, the analysis was extended to wind field (both surface and profile), synoptic conditions, emissions and deposition fluxes. Models predict the onset and evolution of the AOD for all analysed lead times. On average, differences among the models are larger than differences among lead times for each individual model. In spite of large differences in emission and deposition, the models present comparable skill for AOD. In general, models are better in predicting AOD than near-surface dust concentration over the Iberian Peninsula. Models tend to underestimate the long-range transport towards northern Europe. Our analysis suggests that this is partly due to difficulties in simulating the vertical distribution dust and horizontal wind. Differences in the size distribution and wet scavenging efficiency may also account for model diversity in long-range transport.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84932110744&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;656-660;vol.5 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

The forcing and feedback parameters of the net energy flux, as well as its different components at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface, were examined in 10 Earth System Models to better understand the impact of solar radiation management on the energy budget. In spite of their very different nature, the feedback parameter and its components at the TOA and surface are almost identical for the two forcing mechanisms, not only in the global mean but also in their geographical distributions. This conclusion holds for each of the individual models despite intermodel differences in how feedbacks affect the energy budget. This indicates that the climate sensitivity parameter is independent of the forcing (when measured as an effective radiative forcing). We also show the existence of a large contribution of the cloudy-sky component to the shortwave effective radiative forcing at the TOA suggesting rapid cloud adjustments to a change in solar irradiance. In addition, the models present significant diversity in the spatial distribution of the shortwave feedback parameter in cloudy regions, indicating persistent uncertainties in cloud feedback mechanisms. ©2014.

Landscape ecology has an enormous contribution to make to this field, and one could argue, uniquely so. Tools developed or adapted for landscape ecology are being increasingly used to assist with the quantification, modelling, mapping, and valuing of ecosystem services. Several of these tools and methods encased therein are described among the eleven papers presented in this special issue, and their application has the potential to facilitate the management and promotion of services within ecosystems. Papers are associated with each of the four key categories of services that ecosystems provide to humans: supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural. The papers represent work conducted in eleven different countries, especially from South America. Each carries a unique approach to address a particular question pertaining to a particular set of ecosystem services. These studies are designed to inform and improve the economic, environmental and social values of the ecosystem services. This knowledge should help to develop new management alternatives for sustaining and planning ecosystems and the services they provide at different scales in space and time. We believe that these papers will create interest and inform management of some potential methods to evaluate ecosystem services at the landscape level with an integrative approach, offering new tools for management and conservation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84948461078&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;1575-1586;vol.11 is.11;Thomson Reuters ISI

One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is the gathering and availability of the information needed to apply the criteria. We present a complement to the IUCN's methodology to assess the threat level to ecosystems, estimating the spatial and temporal quality of the information available in scientific publications. We did this by applying the IUCN criteria to determine the threat level to the sclerophyll ecosystems of central Chile. Spatially explicit studies that identify disturbances in the structure of the vegetation were selected, making it possible to quantify effectively the reduction in the ecosystems' distribution. The spatial and temporal quality of the assessment were estimated as the percentage of the potential ecosystem distribution and the time frame recommended by the IUCN (50 years), that the studies represented for each ecosystem. The application of the methodology allowed the assessment of a high percentage of the ecosystems (85%), which were classified based on the studies with ranges of temporal quality from 30 to 100% and spatial quality from 12 to 100%. If only the assessments with more than medium spatio-temporal quality are considered (&gt; 50%), eight of the 17 evaluated ecosystems are classified in threat categories, which represents 22.9% of the study area.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES15-00232.1;art282;vol.6 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this article, we analyse the differences of mean of annual and austral-summer (DJF) temperature, precipitation, and sea-level pressure (SLP) over South America (SA) between 1961-1973 and 1978-1990, and explore the occurrence of significant shifts in their time series. Our sources are instrumental records, gridded interpolated data, and reanalyses. Although major regional differences in the intensity of the signal are detected, the climate shift is identified in all variables. In the mid-1970s at annual level, reanalysis SLP data reveal the onset of a step-like anticyclonic circulation anomaly in the southern tip of SA and an abrupt weakening of the Southeast Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone (SEPA). This latter feature may have partly induced the rapid warming observed along the tropical-extratropical west coast of the continent through the weakening of the cold Humboldt current system. An abrupt warming was also detected in surface air temperature (SAT) composites located along the coast of the northern part of SA and in Southeastern SA (SESA). During summer, we found a particularly conspicuous shift-like warming over Southern South America (SSA, comprising Patagonia). Besides, a shift-like increase (decrease) in annual mean precipitation is observed over Central Argentina and in the tropics, to the south (north) of 10°S. In line with previous studies, we conclude that both the interannual (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and the interdecadal (PDO) variability modes seem to have had an incidence in the manifestation of the 1970s climate shift, and that its magnitude appears to be unprecedented during the 20th century, as shown in particular by century-long SAT composites from northern Chile and SSA.;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/2015/00000073/00000006/art00002?crawler=true;185-205;vol.73 is.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

The presence of 30 tephras throughout the record attest for the proximity of the site to active volcanic centres and allows assessment of the role of volcanic disturbance on past vegetation and fire regime shifts. We interpretalternations in dominance between North Patagonian and Valdivian rainforests driven by changes in temperature and precipitation of westerly origin at multi-millennial and millennial timescales. These trends were punctuated by centennial-scale changes, most of which were coeval with or immediately followed the deposition of tephras and/or paleofires. We identify departures of the local vegetation from the regional trend between 2400 and 7100calyrBP, which we interpret as a response of rainforest vegetation and local fire regimes to the disturbance effect of tephra deposition near Lago Pichilafquén. We also find that volcanic disturbance promoted consistent increases in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia within 30 years and paleofires between 60 and 120years following tephra deposition. Comparisons with palynological records having similar span, time resolution and age control suggest that regional climate has played a central role on the establishment, composition and maintenance of temperate rainforests. This influence is overprinted by disturbance regimes at the local and landscape level, driving divergences and heterogeneity especially at times of relatively weak climatic forcing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;http://scielo-test.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-19572015000100008&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en;95-110;vol.50 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Forest cover loss is primarily attributable to fire, logging, and conversion of native forest to agriculture, pasture, and forest plantations, and types of change vary within and among the many diverse types of forests in South America. Major changes in forest cover and growing policy concerns underscore an urgent need for research on sustainable forest management and water ecosystem services in South America. Differences in land ownership and management objectives create trade-offs between wood production and water ecosystem services from forests. Work is needed to quantify how forest change and management affect ecosystem services, such as wood production versus water provision. Current scientific understanding of forest management effects on water ecosystem services in South America has important limitations, including a scarcity of long-term records and few long-term integrated watershed studies. Industry, government, universities, and local communities should collaborate on integrated applied studies of forests and water. Data archiving and publically available data are required. The creation of national networks and a multi-country South America network to identify and implement common water research protocols, share results, and explore their implications would promote common and well-supported policies. Hydrologists working in South America are well placed to tackle the challenges and opportunities for collaborative research that will maintain the intrinsic values and water ecosystem services provided by South America's forests.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181 8115301600;79-87;vol.137;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 ± 9% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 ± 12% and the land the remainder (16 ± 14%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 ± 0.12 °C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.";http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12382/abstract;36-45;vol.25 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Based on statistical evidence from measurements by VLT spectrographs (UVES and CRIRES) covering more than a decade, we find that PWV <0.2mm can be expected on less than 1 per cent of the nights, while <0.5mm is encountered on 6-7 nights per year (≈2 per cent).

To date, we rely on climate models for estimates of dust fluxes to calculate the impact of airborne micronutrients on biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a new global dust flux data set for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions based on observational data. A comparison with dust flux simulations highlights regional differences between observations and models. By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of <10ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further ∼10ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84934894933&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;3330-3349;vol.120 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

Although the most likely dust source for the South Pacific is Australia and New Zealand, the glacial-interglacial pattern and timing of lithogenic sediment deposition is similar to dust records from Antarctica and the South Atlantic dominated by Patagonian sources.

The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20°S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100m3s-1 at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29,000km2 shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765-2004. Summer streamflow represents 45.2% of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (1961-2004) explains 54% of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R2adj=0.54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980s (τ=-0.633, p=1.0144*10-5 for the 1985-2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765.

Paradoxically, mapping approaches meant to inform policy decisions focus on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the biophysical supply of ES, largely ignoring the social mechanisms by which these services influence human wellbeing. If social mechanisms affecting ES demand, enhancing it or reducing it, are taken more into account, then policies are more effective. By developing and applying a new mapping routine to two distinct socio-ecological systems, we show a strong spatial uncoupling between ES supply and socio-ecological vulnerability to the loss of ES, under scenarios of land use and cover change. Public policies based on ES supply might not only fail at detecting priority conservation areas for the wellbeing of human societies, but may also increase their vulnerability by neglecting areas of currently low, but highly valued ES supply.;http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/bosque/v36n3/art06.pdf;383-394;vol.36 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

ENSO exhibits considerable natural variability at interdecadal-centennial timescales5. Instrumental records are too short to determine whether ENSO has changed6 and existing reconstructions are often developed without adequate tropical records. Here we present a seven-century-long ENSO reconstruction based on 2,222 tree-ring chronologies from both the tropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. The inclusion of tropical records enables us to achieve unprecedented accuracy, as attested by high correlations with equatorial Pacific corals 7-8 and coherent modulation of global teleconnections that are consistent with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction9. Our data indicate that ENSO activity in the late twentieth century was anomalously high over the past seven centuries, suggestive of a response to continuing global warming. Climate models disagree on the ENSO response to global warming 3-4, suggesting that many models underestimate the sensitivity to radiative perturbations. Illustrating the radiative effect, our reconstruction reveals a robust ENSO response to large tropical eruptions, with anomalous cooling in the east-central tropical Pacific in the year of eruption, followed by anomalous warming one year after. Our observations provide crucial constraints for improving climate models and their future projections.;http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-16202015000300011&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en http://rcia.uc.cl/index.php/rcia/article/view/1580/1178;11/11/18;vol.42 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

The collapse of human societies is a complex phenomenon where historical and cultural dimensions play a key role, and they may interact with the environmental context. However, the importance of the interaction between socio-economic and climatic factors in explaining possible breakdowns in Native American societies has been poorly explored. The aim of this study is to test the role of socio-economic causes and rainfall variability in the collapse suffered by the Aymara people of the semiarid Andean region of Tarapacá during the period 1820–1970. Our motivation is to demonstrate that simple population dynamic models can be helpful in understanding the causes and relative importance of population changes in Andean agro-pastoral societies in responses to socio-environmental variability. Simple logistic models that combine the effects of external socio-economic causes and past rainfall variability (inferred from Gross Domestic Product [GDP] and tree-rings, respectively) were quite accurate in predicting the sustained population decline of the Aymara people. Our results suggest that the depopulation in the semiarid Tarapacá province was caused by the interaction among external socio-economic pressures given by the economic growth of the lowlands and demands for labor coupled with a persistent decline in rainfall. This study constitutes an example of how applied ecological knowledge, in particular the application of the logistic equation and theories pertaining to nonlinear population dynamics and exogenous perturbations, can be used to better understand major demographic changes in human societies.;http://www.tellusb.net/index.php/tellusb/article/view/25385;art25385;vol.67 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

These forests are also keys for social welfare as a result of their supply of timber as well as ecosystem services. Forests in the ecoregion have been extensively converted to fast growing Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. plantations for timber production promoted by public policies and timber companies. This study describes the results of detailed measurements of hydrology and stream water chemistry in eight small watersheds in south central Chile, subjected to replacement of native temperate rainforest by exotic Eucalyptus plantations. In this system, watersheds have streamside buffers of native forest (SNFW) with varying widths. Results indicate that retention of SNFW counteracts hydrologic effects of Eucalyptus plantations, which are widely known to reduce water yields. A 1.4% rate of increase of the run-off coefficient for each metre of increase of SNFW was observed. In addition, a decrease in the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), nitrate-N, and different sized fractions of particulate organic matter were found in streams draining these plantations as a function of increasing SNFW. Streamside buffer widths of 17-22m for total nitrogen and DIN concentrations and ≥36m for sediments were required to provide comparable values to reference watersheds (100% native forest). The findings from this study suggest that SNFW may significantly reduce adverse effects from exotic species forestry plantations on water provision in an area of south central Chile where exotic forest plantations are rapidly expanding. © 2015 John Wiley;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379115300263 http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84936875083&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;158-167;vol.123;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, the conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changingworld is a challenging task which requires cost- efficient and precise monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth native forest ecosystemwas examined. The vascular plant richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub andherb richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As species richness values are typically count data, the cor- responding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error distribution has to be considered. In this context,we compared the suitability of randomforest (RF) and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)with a negative binomial error distribution. Both models were coupled with a feature selection approach to identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three most im- portant predictors for all four layers were altitude above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy height. Thiswas consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's suitability for estimating species richness,which is its capacity to capture three types of information: micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy struc- tural. Generalized LinearModels showed higher performances (r2: 0.66, 0.50, 0.52, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29%, 19.08%, 17.89%, 21.31% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r2: 0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30%, 21.90%, 18.95%, 21.00% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively). Furthermore, the results of the best GLMweremore parsimonious (three predictors) and less biased than the best RFmodels (twelve pre- dictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values, which RF is unable to properly capture. Fromanecological perspective, thepredicted patterns agreedwell with theknown vegetationcomposition of the area. We found especially high species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these areas, overlap- ping distributions of thermopile sclerophyllos species,water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur. The three main conclusions of the study are: 1) appropriatemodel selection is crucialwhenworkingwith biodiver- sitycountdata; 2) the applicationofRFfordatawithnon-symmetricerrordistributions isquestionable; and3) struc- tural and topographic information derived fromLiDAR data is useful for predicting local plant species richness. ©";http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84938971959&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;6014-6023;vol.42 is.14;Thomson Reuters ISI

The AAIW past variability is poorly understood mainly due to the lack of sedimentary archives at intermediate water depths. We present records of benthic stable isotopes from sediments retrieved with the seafloor drill rig MARUM-MeBo at 956 m water depth off northern Chile (GeoB15016, 27°29.48′S, 71°07.58′W) that extend back to 970 ka. The sediments at this site are presently deposited at the boundary between AAIW and Pacific Deep Water (PDW). For previous peak interglacials, our results reveal similar benthic δ13C values at site GeoB15016 and of a newly generated stack of benthic δ13C from various deep Pacific cores representing the ""average PDW."" This suggests, unlike today, the absence of AAIW at the site and the presence of nearly pure PDW. In contrast, more positive δ13C values at site GeoB15016 compared to the stack imply a considerable AAIW contribution during cold phases of interglacials and especially during glacials. Besides, we used three short sediment cores to reconstruct benthic δ13C values from the AAIW core during the last glacial and found a δ13C signature similar to today's. Assuming that this was the case also for the past 970 kyr, we demonstrate that sea level changes and latitudinal migrations of the AAIW formation site can only account for about 50% of the full range of past δ13C increases at site GeoB15016 during cold periods. Other processes that could explain the remaining of the positive δ13C anomalies are increases in glacial AAIW production and/or deeper convection of the AAIW with respect to preceding interglacials.

Here we use the longest (>  35 years) and most complete in situ mass-balance record, available for the Echaurren Norte glacier (ECH) in the Andes at  ∼  33.5° S, to develop a minimal glacier surface mass-balance model that relies on nearby monthly precipitation and air temperature data as forcing. This basic model is able to explain 78 % of the variance in the annual glacier mass-balance record over the 1978–2013 calibration period. An attribution assessment identified precipitation variability as the dominant forcing modulating annual mass balances at ECH, with temperature variations likely playing a secondary role. A regionally averaged series of mean annual streamflow records from both sides of the Andes between  ∼  30 and 37° S is then used to estimate, through simple linear regression, this glacier's annual mass-balance variations since 1909. The reconstruction model captures 68 % of the observed glacier mass-balance variability and shows three periods of sustained positive mass balances embedded in an overall negative trend over the past 105 years. The three periods of sustained positive mass balances (centered in the 1920s–1930s, in the 1980s and in the first decade of the 21st century) coincide with several documented glacier advances in this region. Similar trends observed in other shorter glacier mass-balance series suggest that the Echaurren Norte glacier reconstruction is representative of larger-scale conditions and could be useful for more detailed glaciological, hydrological and climatological assessments in this portion of the Andes.;http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/EN14265.htm;379-389;vol.13 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

The major conclusion of the first appraisal of prognostic ocean DMS models was that such models need to give more weight to the direct effect of environmental forcings (e.g. irradiance) on DMS dynamics to decouple them from ecological processes. Here, the relative role of light and phosphorus on summer DMS dynamics in subtropical waters is assessed using the ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model NEMO-PISCES in which macronutrient concentrations were restored to monthly climatological data values to improve the representation of phosphate concentrations. Results show that the vertical and temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMS concentrations observed in the Sargasso Sea during the summer months is captured by the model. Additional sensitivity tests show that the simulated control of phosphorus on surface DMS concentrations in the Sargasso Sea is much more important than that of light. By extending the analysis to the whole North Atlantic Ocean, we show that the longitudinal distribution of DMS during summer is asymmetrical and that a correlation between the solar radiation dose and DMS concentrations only occurs in the Sargasso Sea. The lack of a widespread summer DMS paradox in our model simulation as well as in the comparison of discrete and climatological data could be due to the limited occurrence of phosphorus limitation in the global ocean.;http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84928324890&partnerID=tZOtx3y1 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815000478;20-28;vol.60;Thomson Reuters ISI

Linking the concept of multifunctionality with the ecosystem services (ES) approach offers a promising avenue for producing scientific evidence to inform landscape planning, e.g., about the relative utility of land-sharing and land-sparing. However, the value for decision-making of ES-based multifunctionality assessments has been constrained by a significant conceptual and methodological dispersion. To contribute towards a cohesive framework for landscape multifunctionality, we analyse case studies of joint ES supply regarding ten criteria designed to ultimately answer four aspects: (i) the multifunctionality of what (e.g., landscapes), (ii) the type of multifunctionality (e.g., based on ES synergies), (iii) the procedure of multifunctionality assessments, and (iv) the purpose of multifunctionality. We constructed a typology of methodological approaches based on scores for criteria describing the evaluation method and the level of stakeholder participation in assessments of joint ES supply. Surveyed studies and underlying types of methodological approaches (spatial, socio-spatial, functional, spatio-functional) differed in most criteria. We illustrate the influence of methodological divergence on planning recommendations by comparing two studies employing contrasting approaches (spatial and functional) to assess the joint supply of wildlife habitat and agricultural production in the Argentine Chaco. We distinguish between a pattern-based and process-based multifunctionality, where the latter can only be detected through approaches considering the ecological processes (e.g., ES complementarities) supporting the supply of multiple ES (functional and spatio-functional). Finally, we propose an integrated approach for assessing a socially-relevant process-based multifunctionality.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015EF000311/abstract;345-369;vol.3 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970–1990 period. This decreased in the 1990–2000 period and rose again in the 2000–2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041615000340;162-172;vol.13;Thomson Reuters ISI

Chile contains most of the temperate forest in South America and more than half of the temperate forest in the southern hemisphere. Chilean temperate forest is considered to be one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. In this study we assessed the rate of land use and land cover (LULC) change over time, identified the main LULCs replacing native forest, and described how changes have evolved in contrasting physiographical conditions and through different historical phases of the landscape over the last 40 years. To achieve this, we analysed LULC change with particular focus on forest cover in three areas representing different physiographical conditions and histories of human occupation in the Araucanía Region of Chile, namely the Central Valley, the Coastal range, and the Andean range. We found substantial differences in temporal and intra-regional patterns of forest loss and LULC change. In the Central Valley, forest loss started long ago, and the area occupied by native forest nowadays is less than 5% of the landscape. In the Coastal range, rapid land cover change has taken place since 1973, with an increasing rate of forest loss over time. We detected a similar but less intense pattern in the forests of the Andean range. Overall, the general pattern points to a process of landscape homogenization in all three physiographical areas. Exotic tree plantations have spread over large geographical areas, becoming the dominant land cover. Land cover change in the Araucanía Region reflects a model of change in which areas with better environmental conditions and accessibility are occupied first for productive activities. As the availability of suitable areas for the expansion of productive activities diminishes, these activities start to move into physiographical areas which were previously “protected” by adverse environmental conditions or poor accessibility. This model of production growth could lead to the complete deforestation of areas outside national protected areas, and other areas which still remain inaccessible due to technological restrictions on exploitation.;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084017;art084017;vol.10 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

Repositioning of the intertropical convergence zone is thought to have been responsible for changes in tropical hydroclimate during North Atlantic cold spells, but the dearth of high-resolution records outside the monsoon realm in the Indian Ocean precludes a full understanding of this remote relationship and its underlying mechanisms. Here we show that slowdowns of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas stadial affected the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate through changes to the Hadley circulation including a southward shift in the rising branch (the intertropical convergence zone) and an overall weakening over the southern Indian Ocean. Our results are based on new, high-resolution sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope records of well-dated sedimentary archives from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for the past 45,000 years, combined with climate model simulations of Atlantic circulation slowdown under Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 boundary conditions. Similar conditions in the east and west of the basin rule out a zonal dipole structure as the dominant forcing of the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate of millennial-scale events. Results from our simulations and proxy data suggest dry conditions in the northern Indian Ocean realm and wet and warm conditions in the southern realm during North Atlantic cold spells.;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615070;354-367;vol.81 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

In the case of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles associated to the various cell types. We use Kauffman's approach to model GRNs with random Boolean networks (RBNs). In this paper we explore how the topology affects the distribution of the number of fixed points in randomly generated networks. We also study the size of the basins of attraction of these fixed points if we assume the α-asynchronous dynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). It is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cyclic attractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We observe the remarkable property that, in all our simulations, if for a given RBN with Barabási–Albert topology and α-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a fixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast, in the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a fixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller. We contrast the results of the simulations on Barabási–Albert networks with the classical Erdös–Rényi model of random networks. Everything indicates that Barabási–Albert networks are extremely robust. Finally, we study the mean and maximum time/work needed to reach a fixed point when starting from randomly chosen initial configurations.;http://www.inderscience.com/info/ingeneral/forthcoming.php?jcode=ijgw;1-19;vol.in press;Thomson Reuters ISI

Methods We evaluated the association of plant species with U. antarctica cushions by recording species growing - in equivalent areas - within and outside U. antarctica cushions. Additionally, we performed transplant experiments with Deschampsia antarctica individuals to assess if U. antarctica cushions enhance plant survival. In both study sites we monitored temperature, moisture and nutrient status of soil outside and within the cushions to provide insights into potential mechanisms underlying possible interactions between U. antarctica and other plant species. Results Eight out of 13 species were positively associated with cushions of the widespread lichen U. antarctica, while only one species (U. aurantiaco-atra) showed a negative association with U. antarctica. Survival of Deschampsia was enhanced when growing associated with U. antarctica cushions. Our results indicate that cushions ameliorated the extreme conditions of Antarctic islands through increased temperature and soil moisture, decreased radiation and evaporative water loss and increased nutrient availability.

Air pollution associated with biomass burning and urban emissions affects extensive areas of South America. We focus on black carbon (BC) aerosol and its impacts on air quality, water availability, and climate, with an emphasis on the Andean cryosphere. BC is one of the key short-lived climate pollutants that is a topic of growing interest for near-term mitigation of these issues. Limited scientific evidence indicates that the Andean cryosphere has already responded to climate change with receding glaciers and snow cover, which directly affect water resources, agriculture, and energy production in the Andean region of South America. Despite the paucity of systematic observations along the Andes, a few studies have detected BC on snow and glaciers in the Andes. These, in addition to existing and projected emissions and weather patterns, suggest a possible contribution of BC to the observed retreat of the Andean cryosphere. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of these issues from scientific and policy perspectives, and propose strategic expansions to the relevant measurement infrastructure in the region.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2015JD023949;558-575;vol.121 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Environmental filtering suggests that local environmental conditions provide habitat-specific scenarios for niche requirements, ultimately determining the composition of local communities. In this work, we analyze the spatial variation of microbial communities across environmental gradients of sea surface temperature, salinity and photosynthetically active radiation and spatial distance in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. We hypothesize that environmental filters are the main control of the spatial variation of these communities. Thus, strong relationships between community composition and environmental variation and weak relationships between community composition and spatial distance are expected. Combining physical characterization of the water column, cell counts by flow cytometry, small ribosomal subunit genes fingerprinting and next generation sequencing, we contrast the abundance and composition of photosynthetic eukaryotes and heterotrophic bacterial local communities at a submesoscale. Our results indicate that the strength of the environmental controls differed markedly between eukaryotes and bacterial communities. Whereas eukaryotic photosynthetic assemblages responded weakly to environmental variability, bacteria respond promptly to fine-scale environmental changes in this polar marine system.;http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0717-92002016000100009&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en;85-96;vol.37 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Our data indicate that the main phase of the LGT began with abrupt warm pulses at 17,800 and 17,100calyrs BP, accompanied by rapid establishment of evergreen temperate rainforests and extensive deglaciation of the Andes within 1000 years. This response shows that South American middle-latitude temperatures had approached average interglacial values by 16,800calyrs BP. The temperature rise in northwestern Patagonia coincides with the beginning of major warming and glacier recession in the Southern Alps of New Zealand at southern mid-latitudes on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean. From this correspondence, the warming that began at 17,800calyrs BP appears to have been widespread in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, accounting for at least 75% of the total temperature recovery from the LGM to the Holocene. Moreover, this warming pulse is coeval with the first half of the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) in the North Atlantic region. HS1 featured a decline of North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a southward shift of the westerly wind belt in both hemispheres and of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, as well as a weakening of the Asian monsoon. Along with the initiating trigger, identifying the mechanisms whereby these opposing climate signals in the two polar hemispheres interacted -whether through an oceanic or an atmospheric bipolar seesaw, or both- lies at the heart of understanding the LGT.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/sed.12206;1873-1898;vol.62 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

Here we present a stratigraphic record from Lago Cipreses (51°S), southwestern Patagonia, that reveals recurrent ∼200-year long dry/warm phases over the last three millennia, which we interpret as positive SAM-like states. These correspond in timing with the Industrial revolution, the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly, the Roman and Late Bronze Age Warm Periods and alternate with cold/wet multi-centennial phases in European palaeoclimate records.

Reconstructing streamflows from tree-ring data has been recognized as a useful paleoclimatic tool in providing long-term perspectives on the temporal characteristics of hydroclimate systems. Multi-century long streamflow reconstructions can be compared to relatively short instrumental observations in order to analyze the frequency of low and high water availability through time. In this work, we have developed a Biobío River streamflow reconstruction to explore the long-term hydroclimate variability at the confluence of the Mediterranean-subtropical and the Temperate-humid climate zones, two regions represented by previous reconstructions of the Maule and Puelo Rivers, respectively. In a suite of analyses, the Biobío River reconstruction proves to be more similar to the Puelo River than the Maule River, despite its closer geographic proximity to the latter. This finding corroborates other studies with instrumental data that identify 37.5°S as a latitudinal confluence of two climate zones. The analyzed rivers are affected by climate forcings on interannual and interdecadal time-scales, Tropical (El Niño Southern Oscillation; ENSO) and Antarctic (Southern Annular Mode; SAM). Longer cycles found, around 80-years, are well correlated only with SAM variation, which explains most of the variance in the Biobío and Puelo rivers. This cycle also has been attributed to orbital forcing by other authors. All three rivers showed an increase in the frequency of extreme high and low flow events in the 20th century. The most extreme dry and wet years in the instrumental record (1943-2000) were not the most extreme of the past 400-years reconstructed for the three rivers (1600-2000), yet both instrumental record years did rank in the five most extreme of the streamflow reconstructions as a whole. These findings suggest a high level of natural variability in the hydro-climatic conditions of the region, where extremes characterized the 20th century. This information is particularly useful when evaluating and improving a wide variety of water management models that apply to water resources that are sensitive to agricultural and hydropower industries.";http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84944809994&partnerID=tZOtx3y1;art0137569;vol.10 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

The patterns and climate drivers of Araucaria growth have typically been documented on the driest part of the gradient relying on correlations with meteorological records, but the lack of in situ soil moisture observations has precluded an assessment of the growth responses to soil moisture variability. Here, we use a network of 21 tree-ring width chronologies to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of tree growth through the entire gradient and evaluate their linkages with regional climate and satellite-observed surface soil moisture variability. We found that temporal variations in tree growth are remarkably similar throughout the gradient and largely driven by soil moisture variability. The regional spatiotemporal pattern of tree growth was positively correlated with precipitation (r = 0.35 for January 1920-1974; P < 0.01) and predominantly negatively correlated with temperature (r = −0.38 for January-March 1920-1974; P < 0.01) during the previous growing season. These correlations suggest a temporally lagged growth response to summer moisture that could be associated with known physiological carry-over processes in conifers and to a response to moisture variability at deeper layers of the rooting zone. Notably, satellite observations revealed a previously unobserved response of Araucaria growth to summer surface soil moisture during the current rather than the previous growing season (r = 0.65 for 1979-2000; P < 0.05). This new response has a large spatial footprint across the mid-latitudes of the South American continent (35°-45°S) and highlights the potential of Araucaria tree rings for palaeoclimatic applications. The strong moisture constraint on tree growth revealed by satellite observations suggests that projected summer drying during the coming decades may result in regional growth declines in Araucaria forests and other water-limited ecosystems in the Patagonian Andes.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2015JG003098;2505-2524;vol.120 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

Consistent with the subtropical location, cloud types are dominated by stratocumuli having greatest coverage (>7 oktas) and smaller heights (600–750 m) during the nighttime of austral winter and spring. Meridionally, nighttime cloud fraction and cloud-base heights increase from south to north. Long-term trends in mean cloud cover are observed at all sites albeit with a seasonal modulation, with increasing (decreasing) coverage in the spring (fall). Consistent trend patterns are also observed in independent sunshine hour measurements at the same sites. Cloud heights show negative trends of about 100 m decade−1 (1995–2010), although the onset time of this tendency differs between sites. The positive cloud fraction trends during the cloudy season reported here disagree with previous studies, with discrepancies attributed to differences in datasets used or to methodological differences in data analysis. The cloud-base height tendency, together with a less rapid lowering of the subsidence inversion base height, suggests a deepening of the coastal cloud layer. While consistent with the tendency toward greater low-level cloud cover and the known cooling of the marine boundary layer in this region, these tendencies are at odds with a drying trend of the near-surface air documented here as well.

Value elicitation relied on an individual open-ended interview and a mapping exercise. Interpretation of the narratives and GIS calculations of proximity, centrality, and dispersion helped in exploring the factors driving participants’ answers. Narratives reveal diverse value types. Whereas planners highlighted utilitarian and aesthetic values, the answers from researchers revealed naturalistic values as well. In turn community representatives acknowledged symbolic values. When remitted to the map, these values were constrained to statements toward a much narrower set of features of the physical (e.g., volcanoes) and built landscape (e.g., roads). The results suggest that mapping, as an instrumental approach toward social valuation, may capture only a subset of relevant assigned values. This outcome is the interplay between participants’ characteristics, including their acquaintance with the territory and their ability with maps, and the mapping procedure itself, including the proxies used to represent the ES and the value typology chosen, the elicitation question, the cartographic features displayed on the base map, and the spatial scale.;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0028825X.2015.1130726;223-246;vol.54 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0-100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest.

A GIS-based methodological framework was developed and applied to map agricultural heritage (AH), understood as a non-divisible combination of three cultural services (dimensions, D): the heritage value associated to a culturally significant species (i.e. Chiloé native potato) (D1); the traditional systems of knowledge of AH keepers (D2); and the social relations among them (D3). The final aim of the study was to provide indicators of the ""final"" service (AHi, measured in a 0-100 point scale) and its benefits (AHB, measured in US$/ha), capable to display areas where high value farmland was located. In essence, AHi comprised a set of biocultural variables validated and weighted by expert opinion. The experts gave the maximum importance to 5 variables: number of native potato varieties cultivated (D1), use of own seed (D1), form in which cultivation knowledge was acquired by the keeper (D2), exchange of own seed (D3), and number of other potato keepers known (D3). In turn, AHB reflected society's willingness to pay for the nonmaterial benefits of AH conservation.

This study aims at analyzing the correspondence between the purpose of maps (e.g. land use planning) and the procedures used for mapping (e.g. benefit transfer, ecological transfer). Fifty scientific studies published between 2005 and 2012 were selected and analyzed according to 19 variables, applying independence tests over contingency tables, ANOVA and regression analysis. The results show that most studies declared a decision-making purpose (82%), which in 50% of the cases, was land use planning. Only few relationships were found between variables selected to describe the purpose of the maps and those selected to describe the mapping procedures. Thus for example, maps aimed at supporting land use planning did not include any level of stakeholder participation or scenario analysis, as it would have been expected given this purpose. Likewise, maps were based on either economic value or biophysical transfers, regardless of the spatial and temporal scales of mapping. This generally weak relation between map׳s purposes with the used procedures could explain the still restricted incidence of ES on decision-making by limiting the transmission, comparison and synthesis of results.;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/9/905;art905;vol.8 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

In mountain areas with complex topography, climate models have often limited capabilities to adequately simulate the precipitation variability on small spatial scales. Also, their validation is hampered by typically very low station density. In the Central Andes of South America, a semi-arid high-mountain region with strong seasonality, zonal wind in the upper troposphere is a good proxy for interannual precipitation variability. Here, we combine instrumental measurements, reanalysis and paleoclimate data, and a 57-member ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations to assess changes in Central Andes precipitation over the period AD 1000-2100. This new database allows us to put future projections of precipitation into a previously missing multi-centennial and pre-industrial context. Our results confirm the relationship between regional summer precipitation and 200 hPa zonal wind in the Central Andes, with stronger Westerly winds leading to decreased precipitation. The period of instrumental coverage (1965-2010) is slightly dryer compared to pre-industrial times as represented by control simulations, simulations from the past Millennium, ice core data from Quelccaya ice cap and a tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction. The model ensemble identifies a clear reduction in precipitation already in the early 21st century: the 10 year running mean model uncertainty range (ensemble 16-84% spread) is continuously above the pre-industrial mean after AD 2023 (AD 2028) until the end of the 21st century in the RCP2.6 (RCP8.5) emission scenario. Average precipitation over AD 2071-2100 is outside the range of natural pre-industrial variability in 47 of the 57 model simulations for both emission scenarios. The ensemble median fraction of dry years (defined by the 5th percentile in pre-industrial conditions) is projected to increase by a factor of 4 until 2071-2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Even under the strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions projected by the RCP2.6 scenario, the Central Andes will experience a reduction in precipitation outside pre-industrial natural variability. This is of concern for the Central Andes, because society and economy are highly vulnerable to changes in the hydrological cycle and already have to face decreases in fresh water availability caused by glacier retreat.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015WR018429/abstract;5357-5375;vol.52 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

More precisely, we introduce: (1) the standard measure of complementary mutual information or ‘specificity’ index; (2) a new measure of information gain or ‘representativity’ index; (3) the information gaps associated with the evolution of a network and (4) the normalised information distance used in clustering analysis. All these information concepts are illustrated by applying them to 14 yr of data collected by the air quality monitoring network in Santiago de Chile (33.5 S, 70.5 W, 500 m a.s.l.). We find that downtown stations, located in a relatively flat area of the Santiago basin, generally show high ‘representativity’ and low ‘specificity’, whereas the contrary is found for a station located in a canyon to the east of the basin, consistently with known emission and circulation patterns of Santiago. We also show interesting applications of information gain to the analysis of the evolution of a network, where the choice of background information is also discussed, and of mutual information distance to the classifications of stations. Our analyses show that information as those presented here should of course be used in a complementary way when addressing the analysis of an air quality network for planning and evaluation purposes.";http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00267.1;1929-1939;vol.97 is.10;Thomson Reuters ISI

This region also contains the largest group of island nations, most of whom are dependent on marine resources for their livelihoods. Several of the largest coastal and oceanic gisheries also occur in this region (FAO, 2014). In addition, for the countries associated with the southern Pacific Ocean region, the sea provides significant social, cultural and economic benefits, with many countries being heavily reliant on both coastal and oceanic marine resources (Bell et al., 2013). Increasing coastal populations and climate change are expected to augment human demands on already fully exploited or over-exploited marine resources, threatening both food security and sustainable livelihoods (Bell et al. 2011). Therefore, its imperative that the science that describes and predicts linked biophysical and human systems is understood and developed to meet these needs. Climate change will have many impacts on marine ecosystems, with implications for end users including individuals, local communities, industries and governments. Improved scientific support for policy and management decision-making in the face of these potential impacts is essential.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD024835/abstract;4563-4580;vol.121 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this study we used high-frequency sampling (24 measurements per day) of Rs in a temperate rainforest during 1 year, with the objective of answering the questions of when and how often measurements should be made to obtain accurate estimations of daily and annual Rs. We randomly selected data to simulate samplings of 1, 2, 4 or 6 measurements per day (distributed either during the whole day or only during daytime), combined with 4, 6, 12, 26 or 52 measurements per year. Based on the comparison of partial-data series with the full-data series, we estimated the performance of different partial sampling strategies based on bias, precision and accuracy. In the case of annual Rs estimation, we compared the performance of interpolation vs. using non-linear modelling based on soil temperature. The results show that, under our study conditions, sampling twice a day was enough to accurately estimate daily Rs (RMSE  <  10 % of average daily flux), even if both measurements were done during daytime. The highest reduction in RMSE for the estimation of annual Rs was achieved when increasing from four to six measurements per year, but reductions were still relevant when further increasing the frequency of sampling. We found that increasing the number of field campaigns was more effective than increasing the number of measurements per day, provided a minimum of two measurements per day was used. Including night-time measurements significantly reduced the bias and was relevant in reducing the number of field campaigns when a lower level of acceptable error (RMSE  <  5 %) was established. Using non-linear modelling instead of linear interpolation did improve the estimation of annual Rs, but not as expected. In conclusion, given that most of the studies of Rs use manual sampling techniques and apply only one measurement per day, we suggest performing an intensive sampling at the beginning of the study to determine minimum daily and annual frequencies of sampling.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/2016BAMSStateoftheClimate.1;S32-S36;vol.97 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

Precipitation in this region correlates with the intensity of the southern westerly winds (SWW), allowing reconstruction of past SWW behavior through precipitation-sensitive sensors. Recession from the LGM glacier margins exposed the central-east sector of Isla Grande de Chiloé by 17,800calyrBP, followed by the immediate colonization of pioneer cold-resistant herbs/shrubs and rapid establishment of closed-canopy Nothofagus forests by 17,000calyrBP. Broad-leaved temperate rainforests have persisted since then with compositional changes driven by changes in temperature, hydrologic balance and disturbance regimes. We detect low lake levels and enhanced fire activity between 800-2000, 4000-4300, ∼8000-11,000 and 16,100-17,800calyrBP, implying southward shifts and/or weaker SWW flow that alternated with cold, humid phases with muted fire activity. Covariation in paleoclimate trends revealed by the Lago Lepué record with tropical and Antarctic records since the LGM, suggests that the SWW have been a highly dynamic component of the climate system capable of linking climate changes from low- and high-southern latitudes during the Last Glacial termination and the current interglacial. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0041.1;4441-4460;vol.144 is.11;Thomson Reuters ISI

This paper presents the results of two field sampling seasons carried out at the Pilauco Site (ca. 39°S) and compares them with those of three well known sites in Chile: Quereo, Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, ca. 32°, 34° and 41°S, respectively. Stratigraphic data collected at Pilauco and the resulting radiocarbon age model suggest that before 12,540 ± 90 BP the old Damas River eroded an older volcaniclastic hill, which was followed by a bog formation in an ox-bow lake. The site was developing up to 11,004 ± 186 BP, the date of the youngest vertebrate fossil. Two younger peat beds seal the site. As in Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, Gomphotheres are the most represented megafauna. Fossils of Equidae, Camelidae, Cervidae, Mephitidae, Muridae, Myocastoridae and Xenarthra are also found in Pilauco. As a whole, 718 bones, 30 teeth and 11 coprolites represent the extinct and extant vertebrates. Preliminary taphonomic results suggest action of various agents in the bones, i.e. trampling, root etching, abrasion, and carnivore gnawing. The spatial analysis suggests the transfer of smaller anatomical units (e.g. bones of camelids and horses) and the rearrangement of some pieces comparatively large (e.g. gomphothere bones). Similar to the present day north Patagonian landscape, the area where Pilauco site is located had a variety of animal resources, plants and stones in an ecotone between hills, floodplains and wetlands. A total of 101 lithics were recorded: basalt and quartzite were collected from nearby fluvial deposits and dacitic obsidian from the local volcaniclastic deposits. Debitage is the most represented lithic item (75%); cores and marginal edge-trimmed artifacts represented 12 and 13%, respectively. Artifacts and flakes are spatially and temporality associated in the same PB-7 bed with high bone concentrations in some specific areas, between 361 and 424 cm of local altitude. This industry is characterized by a recurrent lithic expedite technology with production of flakes and chips which mastered marginal retouches over the bifacial trimming. This seems to be connected to strategic conditions of high resource diversity, especially of human groups with a high or medium mobility across land. Pilauco represents a site contemporaneous to Monte Verde related as well to the first human occupation in the southern cone of South America, but with higher mammal diversity.";http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015EF000338/full;79-89;vol.4 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

There has been great progress in the last 20 to 30 years in relation to air and water pollution in Chile. Yet after 25 years of unrestrained growth, there remain clear challenges posed by air and water pollution, as well as climate change. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review environmental health in Chile. METHODS: In late 2013, a 3-day workshop on environmental health was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together researchers and government policymakers. As a follow-up to that workshop, here we review the progress made in environmental health in the past 20 to 30 years and discuss the challenges of the future. We focus on air and water pollution and climate change, which we believe are among the most important areas of environmental health in Chile. RESULTS: Air pollution in some cities remains among the highest in the continent. Potable water is generally available, but weak state supervision has led to serious outbreaks of infectious disease and ongoing issues with arsenic exposure in some regions. Climate change modeling in Chile is quite sophisticated, and a number of the impacts of climate change can be reasonably predicted in terms of which areas of the country are most likely to be affected by increased temperature and decreased availability of water, as well as expansion of vector territory. Some health effects, including changes in vector-borne diseases and excess heat mortality, can be predicted. However, there has yet to be an integration of such research with government planning. CONCLUSIONS: Although great progress has been made, currently there are a number of problems. We suspect that the Chilean experience in environmental health may be of some use for other Latin American countries with rapid economic development.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7438775;646-650;vol.13 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

We synthesized charcoal records (a proxy for biomass burning) from the Americas and from the remainder of the globe over the past 2000 years, and compared these with paleoclimatic records and population reconstructions. A distinct post-ad 1500 decrease in biomass burning is evident, not only in the Americas, but also globally, and both are similar in duration and timing to ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change. There is temporal and spatial variability in the expression of the biomass-burning decline across the Americas but, at a regional-continental scale, ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change was likely more important than indigenous population collapse in driving this decline.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1125786516300352;103-116;vol.38;Thomson Reuters ISI

The wind induces strong coastal upwelling that supports one of the most important fisheries in the world. This region lacks a dense network of in situ observations, so the high resolution (0.313°) NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis is used here to present a synoptic climatology of the coastal wind along the Chile/Peru coast. Covariability between the alongshore pressure gradient and alongshore wind, which was previously identified for synoptic time scales near central Chile, is generalized for the whole coast and over annual time scales. Particular attention is paid to three prominent upwelling regions: Pisco (14.8°S), Punta Lengua de Vaca (30.0°S), and Punta Lavapie (36.4°S). Previous work has identified local maxima at these points but these are embedded in a broader low-level jet that exhibits a marked seasonal cycle of strong wind days due to the migration of the anticyclone and is associated with a shift of both the mean wind and a more frequent recurrence of strong wind events. Alongshore wind near Pisco is normally distributed year-round with a seasonal shift in the mean. Larger variability in the mean and distribution is found at Lavapie, associated with the seasonal change in storm tracks. The synoptic evolution that drives high-wind events at each location is characterized. A midlevel trough and surface cyclone precede wind maxima at each location and are followed by strong midlevel ridging and a strengthened surface anticyclone.;http://www.nature.com/srep/2016/160302/srep22457/full/srep22457.html;art22457;vol.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

High-resolution proxy records for the South American monsoon over this period show a coherent regional picture of a weak monsoon during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and a stronger monsoon during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Due to the small external forcing during the past 1000 years, model simulations do not show very strong temperature anomalies over these two specific periods, which in turn do not translate into clear precipitation anomalies, in contrast with the rainfall reconstructions in South America. Therefore, we used an ad hoc definition of these two periods for each model simulation in order to account for model-specific signals. Thereby, several coherent large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies are identified. The models feature a stronger monsoon during the LIA associated with (i) an enhancement of the rising motion in the SAMS domain in austral summer; (ii) a stronger monsoon-related upper-tropospheric anticyclone; (iii) activation of the South American dipole, which results in a poleward shift of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone; and (iv) a weaker upper-level subtropical jet over South America.

Using daily geopotential heights at 700 hPa from the ECMWF ERA40 Reanalysis Project and Cluster Analysis, four WRs are identified, in increasing order of frequency of occurrence, as cyclonic (22.0 %), zonal (24.8 %), meridional (25.2 %) and anticyclonic (28.0 %). The surface climate, cloud distribution and radiation patterns associated with these winter WRs are deduced from satellite (ISCCP) and other observational (E-OBS, ERA40) datasets. The LMDz atmosphere-ocean regional climate model is able to simulate successfully the same four Mediterranean weather regimes and reproduce the associated surface and atmospheric conditions for the present climate (1961-1990). Both observational- and LMDz-based computations show that the four Mediterranean weather regimes control the region’s weather and climate conditions during winter, exhibiting significant differences between them as for temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and radiation distributions within the region. Projections (2021-2050) of the winter Mediterranean weather and climate are obtained using the LMDz model and analysed in relation to the simulated changes in the four WRs. According to the SRES A1B emission scenario, a significant warming (between 2 and 4 °C) is projected to occur in the region, along with a precipitation decrease by 10-20 % in southern Europe, Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, against a 10 % precipitation increase in northern European areas. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation in the Mediterranean are explained by the model-predicted changes in the frequency of occurrence as well as in the intra-seasonal variability of the regional weather regimes. The anticyclonic configuration is projected to become more recurrent, contributing to the decreased precipitation over most of the basin, while the cyclonic and zonal ones become more sporadic, resulting in more days with below normal precipitation over most of the basin, and on the eastern part of the region, respectively. The changes in frequency and intra-seasonal variability highlights the usefulness of dynamics versus statistical downscaling techniques for climate change studies.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025020/abstract;8549-8566;vol.121 is.14;Thomson Reuters ISI

Accordingly, certain questions arise: What are the most effective current climate change educational methodologies?

Research is needed however, exploring both the multilevel factors and processes that determine urban risk and the complex pathways from hazards to impacts, and from perceptions and coping responses to adaptation. This paper analyzes whether and under what circumstances urban populations experience risk in selected Latin American neighborhoods of Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Mexico and Santiago; it assesses their adaptation capacity, i.e., ability to perceive and respond to hazards. It finds that urban risk depends on scale: hazards, adaptation capacities, responses and their underlying societal and physical drivers vary across urban households, neighborhoods and cities. Informality is a state of regulatory flux, where access to land and livelihood options cannot be fixed and mapped according to any prearranged sets of laws and planning mechanisms, that has a profound influence on risk and adaptation capacities across scales. For instance, informality becomes the site of considerable state power where some forms of growth in risk-prone areas enjoy state sanction while others are criminalized. The informal status becomes both a source of stigmatization that disempowers informal neighborhoods and a systemic determinant of lack of access to assets and options for adaptation capacity.";http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0170.1;1185-1202;vol.17 is.4;Thomson Reuters ISI

This paper develops a framework to understand the political-economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and top-down decision making.

Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity.;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159655;art0159655;vol.11 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

A total of 27 circular (50.2 m2) plots with eight subplots each were established. Floristic composition was recorded and quantitative, diametric and age structures were determined. The results show a richness of 77 vascular species (84.4% natives), with Lophosoria quadripinnata presenting the highest relative cover (20.7%). The presence of hemicryptophytes (35%) indicates human intervention in the place. Trees were the main form of growth, being Drimys winteri, Saxegothaea conspicua and Amomyrtus luma the species with higher plant density. The latter two species growing under Chusquea macrostachya and Lophosoria quadripinnata cover. Drimys winteri and Embothrium coccineum were established immediately after the anthropogenic disturbance of clearcutting and burning, confirming the pioneering character of these two species after highly severe disturbances. Regeneration of Nothofagus nitida was scarce in the area, probably associated with low availability and seed dispersal capacity from surrounding forests. Understanding the early response of evergreen forests affected by anthropogenic disturbance is very important for assisting and guiding the ecological restoration of these forest ecosystems.;http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/4967/2016/;4967-4986;vol.16 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

Latitude, elevation, cloud fraction, water vapor, and aerosols have a first-order influence on the distribution of surface solar radiation over the planet, and no single factor explains the combined distribution. The most likely location of the total solar radiation over the surface of the planet is on the pre-Andean Domeyko Cordillera, a mountain range with elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 m. The regional climate of the Atacama is such that extremely low values of water vapor, cloud cover, ozone, and aerosols concur in this region. The atmospheric transparency in the visible and infrared provided by these conditions, together with a relatively high elevation and low latitude, conspire to produce a region where mean total radiation values exceed 300 W m-2. According to a semiempirical model for surface solar radiation that takes into account extinction by gases, clouds, aerosols, and the effect of topography, the maximum is about 310 ± 15 W m-2, although for individual years, especially those with dry summertime Altiplano conditions, the solar maximum should be located in the Altiplano region near to the Chajnantor Plateau. The delicate combination of elements that concurs in the Atacama region still justifies the increase in observational capabilities of solar radiation and atmospheric composition as it was first devised and executed by the pioneers of solar research in Mount Montezuma in the early twentieth century.;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716306954;378-385;vol.204;Thomson Reuters ISI

Although evidences point to the deep Pacific as a major reservoir of this 14C-depleted carbon, its extent and evolution still need to be constrained. Here we use sediment cores retrieved along a South Pacific transect to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of Δ14C over the last 30,000 years. In ~2,500–3,600 m water depth, we find 14C-depleted deep waters with a maximum glacial offset to atmospheric 14C (ΔΔ14C=−1,000‰). Using a box model, we test the hypothesis that these low values might have been caused by an interaction of aging and hydrothermal CO2 influx. We observe a rejuvenation of circumpolar deep waters synchronous and potentially contributing to the initial deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2. These findings constrain parts of the glacial carbon pool to the deep South Pacific.;http://www.nature.com/srep/2016/160908/srep33130/full/srep33130.html;art33130;vol.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

Low level winds transported the forest fire plume towards Santiago causing a striking decrease in visibility and a marked increase in the concentration of both primary (PM10 and CO) and secondary (Ozone) pollutants in the urban atmosphere. In particular, ozone maximum concentrations in the Santiago basin reached hourly averages well above 80 ppb, the national air quality standard. This ozone increase took place at the three sampling sites considered in the present study. These large values can be explained in terms of high NOx concentrations and NO2/NO ratios in biomass burning emissions.;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155019;art0155019;vol.11 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

Within the coastal marine boundary layer (MBL), sea-land breezes are superimposed on the prevailing southerlies, resulting in light northeasterly winds from midnight to early morning and strong southwesterlies in the afternoon. The prevailing northerlies above the MBL and below the top of the Andes are modulated by the onshore-offshore (zonal) flow forced by the diurnal cycle of surface heating/cooling along the western slope of the Andes. The daytime phase of this diurnal cycle is consistent with an enhanced afternoon coastal subsidence manifested in afternoon warming near the top of the subsidence inversion (~1.8 K at 800 hPa), lowering (~130 m) of its base (top of the MBL), and clearing of coastal Sc (stratocumulus) clouds. Results from a numerical simulation of the atmospheric circulation in a mean zonal cross section over the study area capture the afternoon zonal wind divergence and resulting subsidence of about 2 cm s−1 along a narrow (~10 km) coastal strip maximizing at around 800 hPa. Day-to-day variability in the MBL depth during VOCALS-REx shows sub-synoptic oscillations, aside from two major disruptions in connection with a deep trough and a cutoff low, as described elsewhere. These oscillations are phase-locked to those in sea-level pressure and afternoon alongshore southerlies, as found in connection with coastal lows farther south.  From 24-h forward trajectories issued from significant points at the coast and inland at the extremes of the diurnal cycle, it can be concluded that the strong mean daytime Andean pumping prevents any possibility of continental sulfur sources from reaching the free troposphere above the Sc cloud deck in at least a one-day timescale, under mean conditions. Conversely, coastal sources could contribute with sulfur aerosols preferentially in the morning, provided that the weak daytime inland flow becomes partially blocked by the coastal terrain.;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160580;art0160580;vol.11 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

An air quality prediction system is developed to predict such events in near real time up to 3 days in advance for nine cities with regular air quality monitoring: Santiago, Rancagua, Curicó, Talca, Chillan, Los Ángeles, Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno. The system uses the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model configured with a nested 2 km grid-spacing domain to predict weather and inert tracers. The tracers are converted to hourly PM2.5 concentrations using an observationally based calibration which is substantially less computationally intensive than a full chemistry model. The conversion takes into account processes occurring in these cities, including higher likelihood of episode occurrence during weekends and during colder days, the latter related to increased wood-burning-stove activity for heating. The system is calibrated and evaluated for April-August 2014 where it has an overall skill of 53-72% of episodes accurately forecasted (61-76% for the best initialization) which is better than persistence for most stations. Forecasts one, two, and three days in advance all have skill in forecasting events but often present large variability within them due to different meteorological initializations. The system is being implemented in Chile to assist authority decisions not only to warn the population but also to take contingency-based emission restrictions to try to avoid severe pollution events.;http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/927/2016/;927-940;vol.10 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

Although forced ascent over topography typically results in precipitation increasing with altitude (positive OPGs), mean annual OPGs and especially OPGs associated with individual storms can change widely in magnitude and even sign. Precipitation measurements from the Elqui Valley in the semiarid Andes of Chile (30°S) reveal a mean annual OPG of 6.3 mm km−1 (millimeters of precipitation over kilometers in elevation) ranging from −42 to 52 mm km−1 for individual storms over the last 35 years (1979–2013). Reanalysis data and precipitation measurements are used to characterize the observed OPG in this region in relation with their synoptic-scale flow. It is found that the Froude number correlates positively with the OPG, reflecting stronger zonal winds and less static stability during storms that have positive OPGs. Altitude of the Andes barrier jet shows only a weak relationship with the OPG. Significant storms with positive OPGs are typically linked with an austral blocking of the westerlies and an equatorward migration of the midlatitude storm track. For negative OPGs, either a cutoff low or the northern edge of a surface migratory cyclone reaches the Elqui Valley in such a way that significant rainfall only occurs in the near-coastal region without major snowfall accumulation over the Andes.;http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/7/fiw088;fiw088;vol.92 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

Although elevated ages in fluvially transported organic matter are usually explained by erosion of soils and sedimentary deposits, it is commonly assumed that mainly young organic material is discharged from flat tropical watersheds due to their extensive plant cover and rapid carbon turnover. Here we present compound-specific radiocarbon data of terrigenous organic fractions from a sedimentary archive offshore the Congo River, in conjunction with molecular markers for methane-producing land cover reflecting wetland extent. We find that the Congo River has been discharging aged organic matter for several thousand years, with apparently increasing ages from the mid- to the Late Holocene. This suggests that aged organic matter in modern samples is concealed by radiocarbon from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. By comparison to indicators for past rainfall changes we detect a systematic control of organic matter sequestration and release by continental hydrology, mediating temporary carbon storage in wetlands. As aridification also leads to exposure and rapid remineralization of large amounts of previously stored labile organic matter, we infer that this process may cause a profound direct climate feedback that is at present underestimated in carbon cycle assessments.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00382-016-3068-9;4051-4066;vol.47 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

Higher ozone mixing ratios were found northeast of the Santiago Basin and included east of the Aconcagua Valley (~70 km from Santiago) suggesting that photochemical pollution produced in Santiago is capable of passing through the Chacabuco mountain chain (~1.3 km) and have impact downwind from the regions with the largest NOx and VOC emissions. To complement existing surface observations, ozonesonde and tethersonde campaigns were performed in the Santiago Basin and the Aconcagua Valley. The results suggest ozone can accumulate in layers aloft (e.g., >102 ppb at 2 km) similarly to layers observed in complex topography coastal regions like Southern California. Layers of significant ozone concentrations having a near surface origin were observed above the mixed layer and below the subsidence inversion base. We propose that the ozone in this residual layer can be transported large distances (at least to 70 km) to further penetrate into the local environment under conditions of a well-mixed boundary layer.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0757.1;4525-4542;vol.29 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

Model hindcasts of Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) sea level equivalent are forced by reconstructed Antarctic temperatures, global mean sea level and high-latitude, ocean subsurface temperatures, the latter calculated using the DCESS model forced by reconstructed global mean atmospheric temperatures. The model is calibrated by comparing such hindcasts for different model configurations with paleoreconstructions of AIS sea level equivalent from the last interglacial, the last glacial maximum and the mid-Holocene. The calibrated model is then validated against present estimates of the rate of AIS ice loss. It is found that a high-order dependency of ice flow at the grounding line on water depth there is needed to capture the observed response of the AIS at ice age terminations. Furthermore, it is found that a dependency of this ice flow on ocean subsurface temperature by way of ice shelf demise and a resulting buttressing decrease is needed to explain the contribution of the AIS to global mean sea level rise at the last interglacial. When forced and calibrated in this way, model hindcasts of the rate of present-day AIS ice loss agree with recent, data-based estimates of this ice loss rate. © Author(s) 2014.;http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol21/iss3/art24/;art24;vol.21 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.3–5.6 to 3.7–6.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM.

New AMS radiocarbon ages indicate systematic differences between those determined in lake cores (MEN1=7,689 and H1=8,440 cal yrs BP) and surface deposits (MEN1=7,471 and H1=7,891 cal yrs BP), with the lake cores being somewhat older.

Our observations focused on short-term, species-level, tree mortality and sprouting and tephra fall effects on foliage and limb fall. More than 80 % of the thickest deposits were composed of a basal, pumice, gravel layer containing individual clasts up to 6 cm in length overlain by finer gravel and capped by several cm of sandy tephra. In a sample of four plots with tephra thickness ranging from 10 to 50 cm, we observed a wide range of tree mortality: about 8 % of stems living at the time of the eruption were killed by 10 cm of tephra fall and 54 % were killed by 50 cm. However, properties of the affected forest, such as species composition, foliage sprouting and retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics, and tree size/age, strongly influenced survival. The sites with 35 and 50 cm thick deposits were dominated by the deciduous tree Nothofagus pumilio, which was leafless in the austral winter, season of the initial phase of the eruption. The evergreen tree N. dombeyi experienced much higher mortality. The low density of the falling pumice particles appeared to cause minimal abrasion of the canopy.;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160509/ncomms11487/full/ncomms11487.html;art11487;vol.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

These processes included coarse (gravel) and fine (silt to sand) tephra fall, a laterally directed blast, fluvial deposition of remobilized tephra, a variety of low-temperature mass-movement processes, and a pyroclastic flow. Each of these geophysical processes constitutes a type of ecosystem disturbance which involves a distinctive suite of disturbance mechanisms, namely burial by tephra and sediment, heating, abrasion, impact force, and canopy loading (accumulation of tephra in tree crowns). Each process affected specific areas, and created patches and disturbance gradients in the forest landscape. Coarse tephra (‘gravel rain’, >5 cm depth) abraded foliage from tree canopies over an area of approximately 50 km2 north-northeast of the vent. Fine tephra (>10 cm depth) accumulated in tree crowns and led to breakage of branches in old forest and bowing of flexible, young trees over an area of about 480 km2. A directed blast down the north flank of the volcano damaged forest over an area of 4 km2. This blast zone included an area of tree removal near the crater rim, toppled forest farther down the slope, and standing, scorched forest around the blast perimeter. Fluvial deposition of >100 cm of remobilized tephra, beginning about 10 days after initiation of the eruption, buried floodplain forest in distinct, elongate streamside patches covering 5 km2 of the lower 19 km of the Rayas River and several km2 of the lower Chaitén River. Across this array of disturbance processes the fate of affected trees varied from complete mortality in the tree removal and pyroclastic flow areas, to no mortality in areas of thin tephra fall deposits. Tree damage included defoliation, loss of branches, snapping of tree trunks, abrasion of bark and ephiphytes, and uprooting. Damaged trees sprouted from epicormic buds located in trunks and branches, but sprouting varied over time among disturbance mechanisms and species. Although some effects of the Chaitén eruption are very similar to those from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (USA), interactions between biota and geophysical processes at Chaitén produced some unique effects. Examination of vegetation response helps interpret geophysical processes, and disturbance mechanisms influence early stages of biotic response to an eruption.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416516301155;01/12/18;vol.published online;Thomson Reuters ISI

There is increasing knowledge on their ecology, molecular genetics, environmental controls and threats available. However, information on their carbo-nate production and accumulation is still very limited, even though this information is essential for their evaluation as carbonate sinks. The aim of this study is to provide high-resolution reef aggradation and carbonate accumulation rates for Norwegian cold-water coral reefs from various settings (sunds, inner shelf and shelf margin). Furthermore, it introduces a new approach for the evaluation of the cold-water coral preservation within cold-water coral deposits by computed tomography analysis. This approach allows the differentiation of various kinds of cold-water coral deposits by their macrofossil clast size and orientation signature. The obtained results suggest that preservation of cold-water coral frameworks in living position is favoured by high reef aggradation rates, while preservation of coral rubble prevails by moderate aggradation rates. A high degree of macrofossil fragmentation indicates condensed intervals or unconformities. The observed aggradation rates with up to 1500 cm kyr−1 exhibit the highest rates from cold-water coral reefs so far. Reef aggradation within the studied cores was restricted to the Early and Late Holocene. Available datings of Norwegian cold-water corals support this age pattern for other fjords while, on the shelf, cold-water coral ages are reported additionally from the early Middle Holocene. The obtained mean carbonate accumulation rates of up to 103 g cm−2 kyr−1 exceed previous estimates of cold-water coral reefs by a factor of two to three and by almost one order of magnitude to adjacent sedimentary environments (shelf, slope and deep sea). Only fjord basins locally exhibit carbonate accumulation rates in the range of the cold-water coral reefs. Furthermore, cold-water coral reef carbonate accumulation rates are in the range of tropical reef carbonate accumulation rates. These results clearly suggest the importance of cold-water coral reefs as local, maybe regional to global, carbonate sinks.;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n9/full/ngeo2778.html;687-690;vol.9 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

One potentially helpful method for assigning relative chronologies is to use lithic weathering, on the assumption that the most weathered artifacts are also the oldest. Yet, few studies have systematically assessed how local environmental processes affect weathering of surficial lithics. Using macroscopic analyses, we compared the weathering of surficial lithic assemblages from seven mid-to-late Holocene archaeological sites sampled from four different microenvironments in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Changes in polish, texture, shine, and color were used to establish significant differences in weathering between two kinds of locations: interfluves and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites were moderately to highly weathered by wind and possessed a dark coating, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered despite greater exposure to moisture, often lacked indications of eolian abrasion, and lacked dark coatings. Our results show that lithic weathering can be used as a proxy for relative age, but only after considering local environmental factors. The power of such chronologies can be improved by combining archaeological, paleoenvironmental, geomorphological, and taphonomic data.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069243/abstract;6538-6545;vol.43 is.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

This study aims to: i) characterize patterns of beta diversity in global drylands, ii) detect common environmental drivers of beta diversity, and iii) test for thresholds in environmental conditions driving potential shifts in plant species composition. LOCATION: 224 sites in diverse dryland plant communities from 22 geographical regions in six continents. METHODS: Beta diversity was quantified with four complementary measures: the percentage of singletons (species occurring at only one site), Whittake's beta diversity (β(W)), a directional beta diversity metric based on the correlation in species occurrences among spatially contiguous sites (β(R(2))), and a multivariate abundance-based metric (β(MV)). We used linear modelling to quantify the relationships between these metrics of beta diversity and geographic, climatic, and soil variables. RESULTS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall, and to a lesser extent latitude, were the most important environmental predictors of beta diversity. Metrics related to species identity (percentage of singletons and β(W)) were most sensitive to soil fertility, whereas those metrics related to environmental gradients and abundance ((β(R(2))) and β(MV)) were more associated with climate variability. Interactions among soil variables, climatic factors, and plant cover were not important determinants of beta diversity. Sites receiving less than 178 mm of annual rainfall differed sharply in species composition from more mesic sites (> 200 mm). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall are the most important environmental predictors of variation in plant beta diversity in global drylands. Our results suggest that those sites annually receiving ∼ 178 mm of rainfall will be especially sensitive to future climate changes. These findings may help to define appropriate conservation strategies for mitigating effects of climate change on dryland vegetation.;http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V43n1-a01;1-19;vol.43 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

The endangered Fitzroya cupressoides forests of southern South America include stands that are probably the oldest dense forest stands in the world, with long-lived trees and high standing biomass. We assess and compare aboveground biomass, and provide the first estimates of net primary productivity (NPP), carbon allocation and mean wood residence time in medium-age stands in the Alerce Costero National Park (AC) in the Coastal Range and in old-growth forests in the Alerce Andino National Park (AA) in the Andean Cordillera. Aboveground live biomass was 113-114 Mg C ha(-1) and 448-517 Mg C ha(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Aboveground productivity was 3.35-3.36 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and 2.22-2.54 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AA, values generally lower than others reported for temperate wet forests worldwide, mainly due to the low woody growth of Fitzroya. NPP was 4.21-4.24 and 3.78-4.10 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Estimated mean wood residence time was a minimum of 539-640 years for the whole forest in the Andes and 1368-1393 years for only Fitzroya in this site. Our biomass estimates for the Andes place these ecosystems among the most massive forests in the world. Differences in biomass production between sites seem mostly apparent as differences in allocation rather than productivity. Residence time estimates for Fitzroya are the highest reported for any species and carbon dynamics in these forests are the slowest reported for wet forests worldwide. Although primary productivity is low in Fitzroya forests, they probably act as ongoing biomass carbon sinks on long-term timescales due to their low mortality rates and exceptionally long residence times that allow biomass to be accumulated for millennia.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JG003625/abstract;2667-2683;vol.121 is.10;Thomson Reuters ISI

We investigated tree-ring growth and carbon isotopes of the long-lived and high biomass Fitzroya cupressoides in two stands growing in contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range (∼300 years old) and Andean Cordilleras (>1500 years old) of southern Chile. The interannual variability in δ13C was assessed for the period 1800-2010, and changes in discrimination and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) were evaluated in relation to changes in climate and tree-ring growth during the last century. 13C discrimination has significantly decreased, and iWUE has increased since the 1900s in both sites. However, these trends in isotopic composition have been accompanied by different growth patterns: decreasing growth rates in the Coastal Range since the 1970s and increasing growth rates in the Andes since the 1900s. Trees growing in the Coastal Range have become more efficient in their use of water, probably due to reduced stomatal conductance caused by increases in CO2 and warming. Trees growing in the Andes have also become more water use efficient, but this has been likely due to increased photosynthetic rates. Fitzroya forests, including particularly old-growth stands, are responding to recent environmental changes, and their response has been site dependent. The growth of forests under a more Mediterranean climate influence and restrictive soil conditions in the Coastal Range has been more negatively affected by current warming and drying; while the growth of old stands in thewet Andes has been positively affected by changes in climate (decreasing cloudiness) and increasing CO2. Permanent monitoring of these endangered forests under ongoing environmental changes is needed in order to reassure the long-term preservation of this millennial-aged species.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063715301345;84-94;vol.117;Thomson Reuters ISI

This study used automatic point dendrometers to assess the relationship between environmental variables and stem radius contraction and increment in ten Fitzroya cupressoides trees growing in two sites, the Coastal Range (Alerce Costero National Park) and the Andean Cordillera (Alerce Andino National Park) of southern Chile. The growing season in each site, determined using stem daily cycle patterns for each month, was longer in the Coastal Range site than in the Andes. Warmer and sunnier conditions were positively related with daytime tree radius contraction in both areas, and relationships were stronger in the Coastal Range site where more pronounced shrinking events were associated with prolonged warm and dry conditions compared to the Andes. Stem increment was positively related with precipitation and humidity in both sites, reflecting the positive effect of water on cell turgidity and consequent enlargement. Relationships between stem radius change and environmental variables considering longer temporal scales (7 to 31 days), confirmed a stronger association with humidity/vapor pressure deficit and precipitation, rather than with temperature. Although Fitzroya grows in particularly wet and cool areas, current and projected drier and warmer summer conditions in southern Chile may have a negative effect on Fitzroya stem increment and carbon accumulation in both sites. This effect would be more critical in the Coastal Range compared with the Andes though, due in part to more limiting soil conditions and less summer precipitation in this area. Long-term research is needed to monitor different aspects of the response of these endangered ecosystems to this additional threat imposed by climate change.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10661-016-5235-1;264-281;vol.188 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

Visual images in different media, including rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract, non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete, practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here, based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca. 13,000-410. BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions. In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in the economy of local societies.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-016-0184-z;1-15;vol.published online;Thomson Reuters ISI

This is of significant importance in the context of a warmer world, as extreme events such as droughts become more likely. Most of the studies performed so far on vegetation interaction are based on observations. Here we use the land surface model JULES to study the potential of vegetation mixing to mitigate the negative effect of drought events on the land surface through interaction, a mechanism which is difficult to study in situ at large scales. Using a set of simulations with mixed and unmixed vegetation, we show that the carbon, water, and energy fluxes are significantly affected by vegetation competition for water resources. The interaction is in general beneficial for the ecosystem carbon assimilation due to a better use of water resources. This benefit is highest when traits between vegetation types concerning resource competition overlap least. For a tree-grass combination, mixing improves carbon assimilation by 5% to 8% during summer. The NPP benefit of mixing increases further under progressively more resource-limited conditions up to an inflection point with a benefit of 14%, after which it falls back to zero under extremely dry conditions. Mixing also tends to reduce the inter-annual variability of the ecosystem carbon sink and therefore improves the resistance of the ecosystem. Our results highlight the importance of vegetation interaction in climate simulations and impact studies, and the potential of vegetation mixing as a mitigation tool.;http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/9/385;art385;vol.8 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

We review studies of the ecological effects of these tectonic phenomena and how they have been central to progress in the modern development of forest ecology in both regions. Studies of tectonic influences on the dynamics of southern temperate rainforests of Chile and New Zealand published in the 1970s and early 1980s contributed prominently to the shift away from the equilibrium paradigms dominant globally in the 1960s and towards modern non- equilibrium frameworks of forest dynamics.

Data collection was carried out on board the LOMROG III cruise during the boreal summer of 2012. Water samples were collected from the surface to the bottom layer (reaching 4300 m depth) along a South-North transect (SNT), from 82.19°N, 8.75°E to 89.26°N, 58.84°W, crossing the EAB through the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. The Polar Mixed Layer and halocline waters along the SNT showed a heterogeneous distribution of N2O, CH4 and DMSPt, fluctuating between 42-111 and 27–649% saturation for N2O and CH4, respectively; and from 3.5 to 58.9 nmol L−1 for DMSPt. Spatial patterns revealed that while CH4 and DMSPt peaked in the Nansen Basin, N2O was higher in the Amundsen Basin. In the Atlantic Intermediate Water and Arctic Deep Water N2O and CH4 distributions were also heterogeneous with saturations between 52% and 106% and 28% and 340%, respectively. Remarkably, the Amundsen Basin contained less CH4 than the Nansen Basin and while both basins were mostly under-saturated in N2O. We propose that part of the CH4 and N2O may be microbiologically consumed via methanotrophy, denitrification, or even diazotrophy, as intermediate and deep waters move throughout EAB associated with the overturning water mass circulation.

Based on 13 year of reanalysis, in situ observations, and satellite imagery, a synoptic climatology and physical diagnosis reveal two main weather types lead to distinct precipitation systems. The most frequent type (̃80% of the cases) occurs when a short-wave midlevel trough with weak winds and thermally driven mountain winds favor the development of convective precipitation during the daytime. The trough progresses northwest of a long-lasting warm ridge, which produces low-level easterly airflow that enhances its buoyancy as it moves over the arid land of western Argentina toward the Andes. The weak winds aloft facilitate the penetration of the moist easterly flow into the Andes. Midlevel flow coming from the west side of the Andes is decoupled from the low-level maritime air by a temperature inversion, and thus provides little moisture to support precipitation. The less frequent type (̃20% of the cases) occurs when a deep midlevel trough and strong westerly flow produces stratiform precipitation. This type has a baroclinic nature akin to winter storms, except that they are rare in summer and there is no evidence of a frontal passage at low levels. The lifting and cooling ahead of the trough erode the typical temperature inversion over the Pacific coast, and thus allows upslope transport of low-level marine air by the strong westerlies forming a precipitating cloud cap on the western slope of the Andes. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723202016301394;102-113;vol.40 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

Rain gauges between 33°S and 44°S indicate that annual precipitation increases from the Pacific coast to the windward slopes by a factor of 1.8 ± 0.3. Hourly gauges and instantaneous satellite estimates reveal that the cross-barrier increase in annual precipitation responds to an increase in both the intensity and frequency of precipitation. CloudSat satellite data indicate that orographic effects of the Andes on precipitating ice clouds increase gradually from midlatitudes to subtropics, likely as a result of a reduction of synoptic forcing and an increase of the height of the Andes equatorward. To the south of 40°S, the thickness of clouds slightly decreases from offshore to the Andes. The total ice content increases substantially from the open ocean to the coastal zone (except to the south of 50°S, where there is no much variation over the ocean), and then experience little changes in the cross-mountain direction over the upstream and upslope sectors. Nevertheless, the maximum ice content over the upslope sector is larger and occurs at a lower level than their upwind counterparts. In the subtropics, the offshore clouds contain almost no ice, but the total and maximum ice content significantly increases toward the Andes, with values being much larger than their counterparts over the extratropical Andes. Further, the largest amounts of cloud ice are observed upstream of the tallest Andes, suggesting that upstream blocking dominates there.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00382-016-3081-z;387-404;vol.48 is.1-2;Thomson Reuters ISI

While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1σ model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO. ©2015.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-016-0400-6;163-176;vol.12 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

We tested the hypothesis that water quality can be predicted by different biophysical factors. Multivariate statistics based on a geographical information system (GIS) were used to explore the influence of factors (i.e., precipitation, topography, and land uses) on water quality (i.e., nitrate (NO 3 − ), phosphate (PO 4 3 − ), silicate (Si(OH)4), dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (TSS), biological oxygen demand (DO), temperature (T), conductivity (EC), and pH) for two consecutive years in the Itata and Biobío river watersheds, Central Chile (36° 00′ and 38° 30′). The results showed that (NO 3 − ), (PO 4 3 − ), Si(OH)4, TSS, EC, and DO were higher during rainy season (austral fall, winter, and spring), whereas BOD and temperature were higher during dry season. The spatial variation of these parameters in both watersheds was related to land use, topography (e.g., soil moisture, soil hydrological group, and erodability), and precipitation. Soil hydrological group and soil moisture were the strongest explanatory predictors for PO 4 3 − , Si(OH)4 and EC in the river, followed by land use such as agriculture for NO 3 − and DO and silviculture for TSS and Si(OH)4. High-resolution water leaching and runoff maps allowed us to identify agriculture areas with major probability of water leaching and higher probability of runoff in silviculture areas. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that land uses (agriculture and silviculture) explained in 60 % the river water quality variation. Our finding highlights the vulnerability of Chilean river waters to different biophysical drivers, rather than climate conditions alone, which is amplified by human-induced degradation.;;;vol. in press;Thomson Reuters ISI

These exchanges and their relative distributions of compounds/particles are partially controlled by stratification and water circulation. The spatial and vertical distributions of N2O, an important greenhouse gas, along with other oceanographic variables, are analyzed from the Reloncaví estuary (RE) (~41° 30′ S) to the gulf of Corcovado in the interior sea of Chiloé (43° 45′ S) during the austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the estuary regulated salinity and stratification of the water column, clearly demarking the surface (<5 m depth) and subsurface layer (>5 m depth) and also separating estuarine and marine influenced areas. N2O levels varied between 8.3 and 21 nM (corresponding to 80 and 170 % saturation, respectively), being significantly lower (11.8 ± 1.70) at the surface than in subsurface waters in the Reloncaví estuary (14.5 ± 1.73). Low salinity and NO3 −, NO2 −, and PO4 3− levels, as well as high Si(OH)4 values were associated with low surface N2O levels. Remarkably, an accumulation of N2O was observed in the subsurface waters of the Reloncaví sound, associated with a relatively high consumption of O2. The sound is exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts from aquaculture and urban discharge, occurring simultaneously with an internal recirculation, which leads to potential signals of early eutrophication. In contrast, within the interior sea of Chiloé (ISC), most of water column was quasi homohaline and occupied by modified subantarctic water (MSAAW), which was relatively rich in N2O (12.6 ± 2.36 nM) and NO3 − (18.3 ± 1.63 μM). The relationship between salinity, nutrients, and N2O revealed that water from the open ocean, entering into ISC (the Gulf of Corcovado) through the Guafo mouth, was the main source of N2O (up to 21 nM), as it gradually mixed with estuarine water. In addition, significant relationships between N2O excess vs. AOU and N2O excess vs. NO3 − suggest that part of N2O is also produced by nitrification. Our results show that the estuarine and marine waters can act as light source or sink of N2O to the atmosphere (air–sea N2O fluxes ranged from −1.57 to 5.75 μmol m−2 day−1), respectively; influxes seem to be associated to brackish water depleted in N2O that also caused a strong stratification, creating a barrier to gas exchange.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837741730015X?np=y;67-76;vol.184;Thomson Reuters ISI

These are the main sources of available drinking water. Stable isotopes (15N and 18O) for NO3–N and along with a 1-D reactive transport model were used to study the origin and processes that lead to nitrogen transformation and loss in a major stream that flows into a reservoir within an intensively cultivated catchment area (352 km2) in Alentejo-Portugal. Seasonal water samples (October–November 2008, March 2009 and September 2009) of stream surface water, wells and sediment pore water were collected. The results showed consistently increasing isotope values and decreasing NO3–N concentrations downstream. During winter (wet period, November 2008 and March 2009) slightly higher NO3–N concentrations were found in comparison to early fall (dry period: October 2008) and summer (dry period: September 2009). Isotopic composition of 15N and 18O values in surface water samples from the stream and wells indicated that the dominant NO3–N sources were derived mainly from the soil and fertilizers. There was also significant nitrification in surface water at the head of the stream. Sediment pore waters showed high NO3–N values near the sediment-water interface (reaching 25 mg·N·L−1) and NO3–N concentrations sharply decreasing with sediment depth, suggesting significant NO3–N consumption. Denitrification was also detected using the 15N signature in upstream waters, but not downstream where very low NO3–N levels were measured. In the stream, the calculated isotopic enrichment factor for NO3–N was −2.9‰ for 15N and −1.78 for 18O, this indicates that denitrification accounts for 7.8% to 48% of nitrate removal.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.11035/abstract;972-980;vol.31 is.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-016-1010-7;285-297;vol.17 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

The focus is on long-term climate projections designed to 1) quantify the climate change commitment of different radiative forcing trajectories and 2) explore the extent to which climate change is reversible on human time scales. All commitment simulations follow the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and their extensions to year 2300. Most EMICs simulate substantial surface air temperature and thermosteric sea level rise commitment following stabilization of the atmospheric composition at year-2300 levels. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is weakened temporarily and recovers to near-preindustrial values in most models for RCPs 2.6-6.0. The MOC weakening is more persistent for RCP8.5. Elimination of anthropogenic CO2 emissions after 2300 results in slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At year 3000 atmospheric CO2 is still at more than half its year-2300 level in all EMICs for RCPs 4.5-8.5. Surface air temperature remains constant or decreases slightly and thermosteric sea level rise continues for centuries after elimination of CO2 emissions in all EMICs. Restoration of atmospheric CO2 from RCP to preindustrial levels over 100-1000 years requires large artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and does not result in the simultaneous return to preindustrial climate conditions, as surface air temperature and sea level response exhibit a substantial time lag relative to atmospheric CO2.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0073.1;713-727;vol.18 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

Here, we report for the first time soil CO2 effluxes and their partitioning for medium-age and old-growth Fitzroya cupressoides forests growing under contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range and Andean Cordillera of southern Chile. Fitzroya is a high biomass and one of the longest lived species in the world. We characterized soil respiration patterns over almost 2 yr. Annual soil respiration was slightly higher in younger forests from the Coastal Range compared with Andean forests during the first studied year (6.37–6.66 vs. 5.06–6.14 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), and significantly higher during the second year mainly due to a warmer and drier summer (8.08–8.64 vs. 4.98–5.35 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1). Therefore, warmer and drier conditions, likely to become more common in this region under future climate change, were associated with significantly higher respiration in the shallow soils of the coast, but not in the Andes. A higher proportion of autotrophic respiration was found in the Coastal Range forest probably due to a much higher fine root biomass in this site. However, fine root productivity, an important contributor of belowground carbon fluxes, was a little lower (not significantly) in the coastal site (0.81 ± 0.60 vs. 1.50 ± 0.42 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), indicating a longer root residence time in forests from this area. Soil CO2 effluxes from these forests and their root productivity are at the lower end of values recorded for other mature and old-growth temperate wet forests worldwide. The intrinsic longevity and the particularly poor soils and rainy conditions where these forests grow may influence these facts. Interannual climate variability appears to be especially important for soil respiration in the Coastal Range due to the more Mediterranean climate influence and shallow, poor water retention soils in this area.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ecs2.1640;art01640;vol.4 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

For the very first time, a molecular marker source apportionment of ambient organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 was conducted in Temuco. Primary resolved sources for PM2.5 were wood smoke (37.5%), coal combustion (4.4%), diesel vehicles (3.3%), dust (2.2%) and vegetative detritus (0.7%). Secondary inorganic PM2.5 (sulfates, nitrates and ammonium) contributed 4.8% and unresolved organic aerosols (generated from volatile emissions from incomplete wood combustion), including secondary organic aerosols, contributed 47.1%. Adding the contributions of unresolved organic aerosols to those from primary wood smoke implies that wood burning is responsible for 84.6% of the ambient PM2.5 in Temuco. This predominance of wood smoke is ultimately due to widespread poverty and a lack of efficient household heating methods.

Earth Syst. Sci.;;10.5194/hess-21-1295-2017;1027-5606;"Accurate representation of the real spatio-temporal variability of catchment rainfall inputs is currently severely limited. Moreover, spatially interpolated catchment precipitation is subject to large uncertainties, particularly in developing countries and regions which are difficult to access. Recently, satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for a wide range of hydrological applications, from water resources modelling to monitoring of extreme events such as droughts and floods.This study attempts to exhaustively evaluate – for the first time – the suitability of seven state-of-the-art SRE products (TMPA 3B42v7, CHIRPSv2, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIAN-CCS-Adj, MSWEPv1.1, and PGFv3) over the complex topography and diverse climatic gradients of Chile. Different temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) are used in a point-to-pixel comparison between precipitation time series measured at 366 stations (from sea level to 4600 m a.s.l. in the Andean Plateau) and the corresponding grid cell of each SRE (rescaled to a 0.25° grid if necessary). The modified Kling–Gupta efficiency was used to identify possible sources of systematic errors in each SRE. In addition, five categorical indices (PC, POD, FAR, ETS, fBIAS) were used to assess the ability of each SRE to correctly identify different precipitation intensities.Results revealed that most SRE products performed better for the humid South (36.4–43.7° S) and Central Chile (32.18–36.4° S), in particular at low- and mid-elevation zones (0–1000 m a.s.l.) compared to the arid northern regions and the Far South. Seasonally, all products performed best during the wet seasons (autumn and winter; MAM–JJA) compared to summer (DJF) and spring (SON). In addition, all SREs were able to correctly identify the occurrence of no-rain events, but they presented a low skill in classifying precipitation intensities during rainy days. Overall, PGFv3 exhibited the best performance everywhere and for all timescales, which can be clearly attributed to its bias-correction procedure using 217 stations from Chile. Good results were also obtained by the research products CHIRPSv2, TMPA 3B42v7 and MSWEPv1.1, while CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, and the real-time PERSIANN-CCS-Adj were less skillful in representing observed rainfall. While PGFv3 (currently available up to 2010) might be used in Chile for historical analyses and calibration of hydrological models, the high spatial resolution, low latency and long data records of CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42v7 (in transition to IMERG) show promising potential to be used in meteorological studies and water resource assessments. We finally conclude that despite improvements of most SRE products, a site-specific assessment is still needed before any use in catchment-scale hydrological studies.";http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/21/1295/2017/;1295-1320;vol.21 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

It will use two theoretical approaches: that of complex adaptive systems and that of autopoietic social systems (i.e. systems able to maintain themselves in a larger environment, which makes them close to resilient systems). The goal is to suggest a few starting points for the study of this phenomenon, based on contemporary academic sources, in order to show how different theoretical models can be combined.

Indeed, it is a preoccupation for the countries (mostly vulnerable) that will suffer those damages, but also for the States that emitted greenhouse gases which fear to have to repair them. That’s why the international negotiation related to the climate regime use the ambiguous term “loss and damage” to design the impacts related to climate change. The purpose of this article is to know if the term “loss and damage” is a useful one in view of reparation under international law or if it is necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion employed by the doctrine. More precisely, the central question is the following: why is it necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion? Even though “loss and damage” could formally be a legal concept, it is substantially useless with regard to reparation under international law because it is too ambiguous. Therefore, we judged necessary to clarify the concept of “climate change damage” used by the doctrine but that unfortunately defines it insufficiently. Indeed, it could be useful for the doctrine but also for the lawyers of vulnerable countries and the judges to dispose of a legal notion in order to consider the reparation of the damages related to climate change under international law. Consequently, we propose in this article a definition of climate change damage that could be useful with regard to reparation under international law.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096316300213;103-111;vol.13;Scopus

La disponibilidad hídrica, actividades económicas, interacciones sociales, migraciones, planificación e implementación de políticas públicas a diferentes escalas, e incluso la biodiversidad del planeta se relacionan con las tendencias climáticas o con la recurrencia de eventos extremos y los escenarios futuros. A nivel global, eventos meteorológicos extremos tales como sequías, tormentas de viento, olas de calor, inundaciones fluviales y costeras han aumentado considerablemente en las últimas décadas (ver Jennings 2011), y las proyecciones climáticas (IPCC, 2014) muestran que estos serán más frecuentes y severos.

Observations were made in the eastern South Pacific (ESP), between 10° and 60°S, and ~75°–88°W, from intermediate waters targeting Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) at potential density of 27.0–27.1 kg m−3. Between 60° and 20°S, a gradual equatorward increase of N2O from 8 to 26 nmol L−1 was observed at density 27.0–27.1 kg m−3 where AAIW penetrates. Positive correlations were found between apparent N2O production (ΔN2O) and O2 utilization (AOU), and between ΔN2O and NO−3NO3−, which suggested that local N2O production is predominantly produced by nitrification. Closer to the equator, between 20° and 10°S at AAIW core, a strong N2O increase up to 75 nmol L−1 was observed. Because negative correlations were found between ΔN2O vs. NO−3NO3− and ΔN2O vs. N* (a Nitrogen deficit index) and because ΔN2O and AOU do not follow a linear trend, we suspect that, in addition to nitrification, denitrification also takes place in N2O cycling. By making use of water mass mixing analyses, we show that an increase in N2O occurs in the region where high oxygen from AAIW merges with low oxygen from Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW), creating favorable conditions for local N2O production. We conclude that the non-linearity in the relationship between N2O and O2 is a result of mixing between two water masses with very different source characteristics, paired with the different time frames of nitrification and denitrification processes that impact water masses en route before they finally meet and mix in the ESP region.;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2017.00024/full;art24;vol.4;Scopus

However, the nature of the climate change problem (well described as a tragedy of the commons) makes it difficult for individuals to recognise their personal duty to implement behavioural changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, this article aims to analyse the climate change issue from a human-scale perspective, in which each of us has a clearly defined personal quota of CO2 emissions that limits our activity and there is a finite time during which CO2  emissions must be eliminated to achieve the “well below 2 °C” warming limit set by the Paris Agreement of 2015 (COP21). Thus, this work’s primary contribution is to connect an  equal per capita fairness approach to a global carbon budget, linking personal levels with planetary levels. Here, we show that a personal quota of 5.0 tons of CO 2 yr -1 p -1 is a representative value for both past and future emissions; for this level of a constant per capita emissions and without considering any mitigation, the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2030 and 2050, respectively. These are references years that provide an order of magnitude of the time that is left to reverse the global warming trend. More realistic scenarios that consider a smooth transition toward a zero-emission world show that the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2040 and 2080, respectively. Implications of this paper include a return to personal responsibility following equity principles among individuals, and a definition of boundaries to the personal emissions of CO2 .";http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179705;1-29;vol.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

Regionally, a large fraction of the emitted dust is produced in North Africa, however the total emission flux from this region is still highly uncertain. In order to reduce these uncertainties, emission estimates through top-down approaches (i.e., usually models constrained by observations) had been successfully developed and implemented. Such studies usually rely on a single observational dataset and propagate the possible observational errors of this dataset onto the emission estimates. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five different satellites are assimilated one by one in a source inversion system to estimate dust emission fluxes over northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We estimate mineral dust emissions for the year 2006 and discuss the impact of the assimilated dataset on the analysis. We find a relatively large dispersion in flux estimates among the five experiments, which can likely be attributed to differences in the assimilated observation datasets and their associated error statistics. We also show how the assimilation of a variety of AOD products can help to identify systematic errors in models.;http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/7111/2017/;1-22;vol.17;Thomson Reuters ISI

Evidence suggests that trash basket epiphytes (TBE) can be considered ecosystem engineers of forest canopies, due to their relationship with arboreal soil availability and treetop communities. Here we evaluated whether the TBE Fascicularia bicolor (Bromeliaceae), modulates temperature and humidity in the forest canopy. We also investigated if this bromeliad is related with greater arboreal soil accumulation and is associated to higher diversity of other epiphytic plants and invertebrates in the canopy of the South-American temperate rainforest (SATR), in Chile. We measured temperature and humidity in ten trees within the forest before and after the experimental addition of F. bicolor. We also related the presence of F. bicolor with occurrence of soil macrofauna and other canopy dwelling plants in a comparative field survey.
Temperature variability in the canopy was reduced by F. bicolor. Soil availability was higher in siteswith mats of F. bicolor. The richness of vascular epiphytes was unaltered by the presence of F. bicolor,but species composition differed between sites with and without mats on each tree. At the group level,the cover of lichens and bryophytes was greater in sites without F. bicolor, while vascular epiphytes showa larger cover in sites with F. bicolor. The species richness of invertebrates increased in treetop sites colonized by F. bicolor but species composition was not different from soil in branch bifurcations.

The city’s poor air quality is a result of sustained emissions and stable atmospheric conditions, averse to mixing and ventilation and favorable for the formation of oxidants and secondary aerosols. Identifying and quantifying the sources that contribute to the ambient levels of pollutants is key for designing adequate mitigation measures. Knowledge about the temporal evolution of the contribution of each source to ambient pollution levels is also paramount to evaluate the effectiveness of pollution reduction measures that have been implemented in the past decades. Here, we quantify the main sources that have contributed to fine
particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) between 1998 and 2012 in Santiago’s center by using two different source-receptor models (PMF 5.0 and Unmix 6.0), that re applied to elemental measurements on 1243 24-hour filter samples of ambient PM 2.5 collected between April-1998 to August-2012. Both models resolve six sources that contribute to ambient PM 2.5 : motor vehicles (37%), industrial sources (19%), copper smelters (14%), wood burning (12%), coastal sources (10%), and urban dust (3%).
Our results show that over the 15 years analyzed here, the emissions from motor vehicles, industrial sources, copper
smelters, and coastal sources declined by about 21, 39, 81, 59, and 59% respectively, while wood burning didn’t change and urban dust increase by 72%. These changes are consistent with emission reduction measures, such as improved vehicle and smelting technology, introduction of low sulfur fuel for vehicles and natural gas for industrial processes, emission controls for vehicles, public transport improvements etc.. However, it is also apparent that the mitigation expected from improved public transport, vehicle technology, and fuel has been largely nullified by the ever-rising number of private vehicle journeys in the past decade. As a consequence, Santiago still experiences PM 2.5 levels above the annual and 24-hours Chilean and World Health Organization standards";http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2017-18/;1-21;vol. in press;Thomson Reuters ISI

Water resources in the MA are under pressure due to the extensive development of industrial agriculture and mining activities. This pressure is increasing as the region faces one of its worst recorded droughts. Previous studies have pointed to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the main climatic force impacting the MA. However, the role of decadal and multidecadal climate variability, their spatial patterns and the recurrence of long-term droughts, remains poorly studied. In this contribution to a better understanding of these factors, spatial and temporal patterns of hydroclimatic variability are analyzed using an extensive database of streamflow, precipitation, and snowpack covering the period between 1910 – 2011. These analyses are based on the combination of correlation, principal components and kernel-estimation techniques. Despite a general common pattern across the MA region, our results identify two hydroclimatic sub-regions, located north and south of 34°S. While the interannual variability associated with ENSO is slightly stronger north of 34°S, the variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and/or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation index (IPO) shows similar patterns in both regions. However, variations produced by the IPO forcing seem to be greater in the southern sub-region since 1975. Our estimations on drought recurrence reveal a generalized increase in dry extremes since the 1950’s. These findings suggest that the northern MA are more vulnerable to changes in hydrology and climate than the southern MA.";http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0004.1;1-44;vol. in press;Thomson Reuters ISI

The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 °C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5 %, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10 % at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6 % decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22 %. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajós is reduced by 31 % in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34 % over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27 % in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajós. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.;http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/21/1455/2017/;1455-1475;vol.21;Thomson Reuters ISI

The availability of long-term ozone records is far better in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, and recent analyses of the seven accessible records in the Southern Hemisphere have shown inconclusive trends. Since late 1995, surface ozone is measured in situ at ""El Tololo"", a high-altitude (2200 m a.s.l.) and pristine station in Chile (30° S, 71° W). The dataset has been recently fully quality controlled and reprocessed. This study presents the observed ozone trends and annual cycles and identifies key processes driving these patterns. From 1995 to 2010, an overall positive trend of  ∼  0.7 ppb decade−1 is found. Strongest trends per season are observed in March and April. Highest mole fractions are observed in late spring (October) and show a strong correlation with ozone transported from the stratosphere down into the troposphere, as simulated with a model. Over the 20 years of observations, the springtime ozone maximum has shifted to earlier times in the year, which, again, is strongly correlated with a temporal shift in the occurrence of the maximum of simulated stratospheric ozone transport at the site. We conclude that background ozone at El Tololo is mainly driven by stratospheric intrusions rather than photochemical production from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. The major footprint of the sampled air masses is located over the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, due to the negligible influence of local processes, the ozone record also allows studying the influence of El Niño and La Niña episodes on background ozone levels in South America. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, during La Niña conditions, ozone mole fractions reach higher levels than during El Niño conditions.";http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/6477/2017/;6477-6492;vol.17;Thomson Reuters ISI

Using partitioned spectral data, a regional climatology of wind sea and swell parameters was constructed. In general, the simulated SWH shows a good agreement with satellite and in situ SWH measurements, although the model appears to have a spatially uniform bias of approximately 0.3 m. The spatial pattern of SWH is clearly influenced by the meridional variation of mean surface wind speed, where the stronger winds over the Southern Ocean play a significant role generating higher waves at higher latitudes. Nevertheless, regional features are observed in the annual variability of SWH, which are associated with the existence of atmospheric coastal low-level jets off the coast of Peru and central Chile. In particular, the seasonal variation of these synoptic scale jets shows a direct relationship with the annual variability of SWH and with the probability of occurrence of wind sea conditions. Off the coast of Peru at approximately 15 ∘ S the coastal low-level jet is strongest during austral winter, increasing the wind sea SWH. In contrast, off central Chile, there is an important increase of wind sea SWH during summer.  The seasonal variation of the wind sea component leads to a contrasting seasonal variation of the total SWH at these locations: off Peru the coastal jet amplifies the annual variability of SWH, while off Central Chile the annual variability of SWH is suppressed by the presence of the coastal jet. Although the general conclusions of this research are considered to be robust, we discuss the limitations of the spectral partitioning method used to distinguish wind sea and swell-sea states.;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.5084/abstract;;vol.37;Thomson Reuters ISI

Developing well-targeted public policies requires further research on adaptation. Specifically, understanding the public perception of drought can help to identify drivers of and barriers to adaptation and options.

Our results show that over the 15 years analyzed here, four of the resolved sources significantly decreased 95 % confidence interval: motor vehicles 21.3 % 2.6, 36.5, industrial sources 39.3 % 28.6, 48.4, copper smelters 81.5 % 75.5, 85.9, and coastal sources 58.9 % 38.5, 72.5, while wood burning did not significantly change and urban dust increased by 72 % 48.9, 99.9. These changes are consistent with emission reduction measures, such as improved vehicle emission standards, cleaner smelting technology, introduction of low-sulfur diesel for vehicles and natural gas for industrial processes, public transport improvements, etc. However, it is also apparent that the mitigation expected from the above regulations has been partially offset by the increasing amount of private vehicle use in the city, with motor vehicles becoming the dominant source of ambient PM2.5 in recent years. Consequently, Santiago still experiences ambient PM2.5 levels above the annual and 24 h Chilean and World Health Organization standards, and further regulations are required to reach ambient air quality standards;https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/10093/2017/;10093-10107;Vol.17 is.16;Thomson  Reuters ISI

However, studies focusing on plant diversity, addressed from the remote sensing perspective, are still scarce in these environments. In the present study, predictions of vascular plant richness and diversity were performed in three anthropogenic peatlands on Chiloé Island, Chile, using free satellite data from the sensors OLI, ASTER, and MSI. Also, we compared the suitability of these sensors using two modeling methods: random forest (RF) and the generalized linear model (GLM). As predictors for the empirical models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and textural metrics. Variable importance was estimated using recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen out of the 17 predictors chosen by RFE were textural metrics, demonstrating the importance of the spatial context to predict species richness and diversity. Non-significant differences were found between the algorithms; however, the GLM models often showed slightly better results than the RF. Predictions obtained by the different satellite sensors did not show significant differences; nevertheless, the best models were obtained with ASTER (richness: R2 = 0.62 and %RMSE = 17.2, diversity: R2 = 0.71 and %RMSE = 20.2, obtained with RF and GLM respectively), followed by OLI and MSI. Diversity obtained higher accuracies than richness; nonetheless, accurate predictions were achieved for both, demonstrating the potential of free satellite data for the prediction of relevant community characteristics in anthropogenic peatland ecosystems. © 2017 by the authors.";http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/7/681;681;Vol.9 is.7;Thomson Reuters ISI

On that day the biomass-burning plume was transported by low-intensity winds towards the metropolitan area of Santiago and impacted the concentration of pollutants in this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) is implemented to investigate the biomass-burning plume associated with these wildfires nearby Santiago, which impacted the ground-level ozone concentration and exacerbated Santiago's air quality. Meteorological variables simulated by WRF/Chem are compared against surface and radiosonde observations, and the results show that the model reproduces fairly well the observed wind speed, wind direction air temperature and relative humidity for the case studied. Based on an analysis of the transport of an inert tracer released over the locations, and at the time the wildfires were captured by the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the model reproduced reasonably well the transport of biomass burning plume towards the city of Santiago de Chile within a time delay of two hours as observed in ceilometer data. A six day air quality simulation was performed: the first three days were used to validate the anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, and the last three days (during and after the wildfire event) to analyze the performance of WRF/Chem plume-rise model within FINNv1 fire emission estimations. The model presented a satisfactory performance on the first days of the simulation when contrasted against data from the well-established air quality network over the city of Santiago de Chile. These days represent the urban air quality base case for Santiago de Chile unimpacted by fire emissions. However, for the last three simulation days, which were impacted by the fire emissions, the statistical indices showed a decrease in the model performance. While the model showed a satisfactory evidence that wildfires plumes that originated in the vicinity of Santiago de Chile were transported towards the urban area and impacted the air quality, the model still underpredicted some pollutants substantially, likely due to misrepresentation of fire emission sources during those days. Potential uncertainties may include to the land use/land cover classifications and its characteristics, such as type and density of vegetation assigned to the region, where the fire spots are detected. The variability of the ecosystem type during the fire event might also play a role.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1352231017304430;79-91;vol.166;Thomson Reuters ISI

S., Farías, L.;Vertical segregation among pathways mediating nitrogen loss (N2 and N2O production) across the oxygen gradient in a coastal upwelling ecosystem;Biogeosciences;;10.5194/bg-14-4795-2017;1726-4189;The upwelling system off central Chile (36.5 S) is seasonally subjected to oxygen (O2)-deficient waters, with a strong vertical gradient in O2 (from oxic to anoxic conditions) that spans a few metres (30-50€m interval) over the shelf. This condition inhibits and/or stimulates processes involved in nitrogen (N) removal (e.g. anammox, denitrification, and nitrification). During austral spring (September 2013) and summer (January 2014), the main pathways involved in N loss and its speciation, in the form of N2 and/or N2O, were studied using 15N-tracer incubations, inhibitor assays, and the natural abundance of nitrate isotopes along with hydrographic information. Incubations were developed using water retrieved from the oxycline (25€m depth) and bottom waters (85€m depth) over the continental shelf off Concepción, Chile. Results of 15N-labelled incubations revealed higher N removal activity during the austral summer, with denitrification as the dominant N2-producing pathway, which occurred together with anammox at all times. Interestingly, in both spring and summer maximum potential N removal rates were observed in the oxycline, where a greater availability of oxygen was observed (maximum O2 fluctuation between 270 and 40€μmol€L'1) relative to the hypoxic bottom waters ( < €20€μmol€O2€L'1). Different pathways were responsible for N2O produced in the oxycline and bottom waters, with ammonium oxidation and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, respectively, as the main source processes. Ammonium produced by dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNiRA) could sustain both anammox and nitrification rates, including the ammonium utilized for N2O production. The temporal and vertical variability of /15N-NO3' confirms that multiple N-cycling processes are modulating the isotopic nitrate composition over the shelf off central Chile during spring and summer. N removal processes in this coastal system appear to be related to the availability and distribution of oxygen and particles, which are a source of organic matter and the fuel for the production of other electron donors (i.e. ammonium) and acceptors (i.e. nitrate and nitrite) after its remineralization. These results highlight the links between several pathways involved in N loss. They also establish that different mechanisms supported by alternative N substrates are responsible for substantial accumulation of N2O, which are frequently observed as hotspots in the oxycline and bottom waters. Considering the extreme variation in oxygen observed in several coastal upwelling systems, these findings could help to understand the ecological and biogeochemical implications due to global warming where intensification and/or expansion of the oceanic OMZs is projected.;https://www.biogeosciences.net/14/4795/2017/;4795-4813;vol.14;Thomson Reuters ISI

Although intense 1- or 2-year droughts are recurrent in this Mediterranean-like region, the ongoing event stands out because of its longevity and large spatial extent. The extraordinary character of the so-called Central Chile Mega Drought (MD) was established against century long historical records and a millennial tree-ring reconstruction of regional precipitation. The largest MD-averaged rainfall relative anomalies occurred in the northern, semi-arid sector of central Chile but the event was unprecedented to the south of 35° S. ENSO neutral conditions have prevailed since 2011 (but for the strong El Niño 2015) contrasting with La Niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts. The precipitation deficit diminished the Andean snowpack and resulted in amplified declines (up to 90 %) of river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central Chile and westernmost Argentina. In some semiarid basins we also found a conspicuous decrease in the runoff-to-rainfall coefficient. A substantial decrease in vegetation productivity occurred in the shrubland-dominated, northern sector, but a mix of greening and browning patches occurred farther south where irrigated croplands and exotic forest plantations dominate. The ongoing warming in central Chile, making the MD one of the warmest 6-year period on record, may have also contributed to such complex vegetation changes by increasing potential evapotranspiration. The understanding of the nature and biophysical impacts of the MD contributes to preparedness efforts to face a dry, warm future regional climate scenario.;https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2017-191/;1-37;;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, in ecosystems with no fire history, it can be a cause of land degradation when it is suddenly introduced by humans, as plant species may not be able to respond to such novel disturbance. Unlike other Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the world, natural fires have not been frequent during the Quaternary in the matorral of Central Chile, and thus, plant adaptive responses are expected to be uncommon. We evaluated the effect of heat shock on seed survival and germination of 21 native woody plants of the Chilean matorral and compiled information on smoke-stimulation and resprouting, to evaluate the importance of fire-adaptive responses in the context of the other MTE. We found that in the Chilean woody flora negative seed responses to fire cues were more frequent than positive responses. Although resprouting is a relatively widespread trait, fire-stimulated germination is not as common in the Chilean matorral as in other MTE. The seeds of seven endemic species were strongly damaged by fire cues and this should be considered in post-fire restoration planning. However, our results also showed that many species were resistant to elevated doses of heat shock and in some, germination was even stimulated. Thus, future research should focus on the evolutionary causes of these responses. These findings could help to develop strategies for fire management in the Chilean matorral. In addition, they will improve our understanding of the evolutionary forces that shaped this plant community and to better frame this region among the other MTE worldwide.;http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180661;e0180661;vol.12;Thomson Reuters ISI

Based on a few selected but representative cases, we found that under rainy conditions—either at day or night—temperature decreases with height close to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (~6.5 °C/km). Likewise, the temperature tends to follow the dry adiabat (~9.8 °C/km) during daytime under dry- and clear-skies conditions. During clear-skies nights, the temperature also decreases with height over the southeastern side of NM, but it often increases (at about 8 °C/km) over the northwestern side of the mountains. This temperature inversion extends up to about 700-m ASL leading to an average temperature contrast of about 7 °C between the northwestern and southeastern sides of Nahuelbuta by the end of dry nights. These dawns also feature substantial temperature differences (>10 °C) among closely located stations at a same altitude. High-resolution numerical simulations suggest that upstream blocking of the prevailing SE flow, hydrostatic mountain waves, and strong downslope winds is responsible for such distinctive nocturnal temperature distribution.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00703-017-0555-4;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

Here we report the largest Southern Hemisphere network of annually resolved tree ring fire histories, consisting of 1,767 fire-scarred trees from 97 sites (from 22 °S to 54 °S) in southern South America (SAS), to quantify the coupling of SAM and regional wildfire variability using recently created multicentury proxy indices of SAM for the years 1531–2010 AD. We show that at interannual time scales, as well as at multidecadal time scales across 37–54 °S, latitudinal gradient elevated wildfire activity is synchronous with positive phases of the SAM over the years 1665–1995. Positive phases of the SAM are associated primarily with warm conditions in these biomass-rich forests, in which widespread fire activity depends on fuel desiccation. Climate modeling studies indicate that greenhouse gases will force SAM into its positive phase even if stratospheric ozone returns to normal levels, so that climate conditions conducive to widespread fire activity in SAS will continue throughout the 21st century. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Recent work suggests that integrating satellite measurements of canopy height within ecosystem models is a promising approach to infer biomass. We tested the feasibility of this approach to retrieve aboveground biomass (AGB) at three tropical forest sites by assimilating remotely sensed canopy height derived from a texture analysis algorithm applied to the high-resolution Pleiades imager in the Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems Canopy (ORCHIDEE-CAN) ecosystem model. While mean AGB could be estimated within 10% of AGB derived from census data in average across sites, canopy height derived from Pleiades product was spatially too smooth, thus unable to accurately resolve large height (and biomass) variations within the site considered. The error budget was evaluated in details, and systematic errors related to the ORCHIDEE-CAN structure contribute as a secondary source of error and could be overcome by using improved allometric equations.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017GL074150;6823-6832;vol.44;Thomson Reuters ISI

It is an interval when insolation was similar to the present, but global ice volume was at a maximum, eustatic sea level was at or close to a minimum, greenhouse gas concentrations were lower, atmospheric aerosol loadings were higher than today, and vegetation and land-surface characteristics were different from today. The LGM has been a focus for the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) since its inception, and thus many of the problems that might be associated with simulating such a radically different climate are well documented. The LGM state provides an ideal case study for evaluating climate model performance because the changes in forcing and temperature between the LGM and pre-industrial are of the same order of magnitude as those projected for the end of the 21st century. Thus, the CMIP6 LGM experiment could provide additional information that can be used to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity. The design of the Tier 1 LGM experiment (lgm</i>) includes an assessment of uncertainties in boundary conditions, in particular through the use of different reconstructions of the ice sheets and of the change in dust forcing. Additional (Tier 2) sensitivity experiments have been designed to quantify feedbacks associated with land-surface changes and aerosol loadings, and to isolate the role of individual forcings. Model analysis and evaluation will capitalize on the relative abundance of paleoenvironmental observations and quantitative climate reconstructions already available for the LGM.;https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4035/2017/;4035-4055;vol.10;Thomson Reuters ISI

The results show that research studies have focussed on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, and adaptations to climate change in agriculture. There is little policy research on other vulnerable sectors (e.g., water and health) and emitting sectors (e.g., energy and industry) in the context of rural development. Our analysis highlights the various research gaps that deserve increased scientific attention, including: cross-sector approaches, multi-level governance, and the stages of policy adoption, implementation and evaluation.

Thirty-three percent of foothill rainfall fell during warm rain periods, while 50% of rainfall fell during ice-initiated periods. Warm rain drop size distributions were characterized by many more and relatively smaller drops than ice-initiated drop size distributions. Both the portion and properties of warm and ice-initiated rainfall compare favorably with observations of coastal mountain rainfall at a similar latitude in California. Orographic enhancement is consistently strong for rain of both types, suggesting that seeding from ice aloft is not a requisite for large orographic enhancement. While the data suggest that orographic enhancement may be greater during warm rain regimes, the difference in orographic enhancement between regimes is not significant. Sounding launches indicate that differences in orographic enhancement are not easily explainable by differences in low-level moisture flux or nondimensional mountain height between the regimes.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0005.1;2723-2743;vol.18;Thomson Reuters ISI

The highly dynamic Formative (or Neolithic) period in northern Chile (ca. 3700–1550 yr BP) brought about the local establishment of agriculture, introduction of new crops (maize, quinoa, manioc, beans, etc.) along with a major population increase, new emergent villages and technological innovations. Even trees such as the Algarrobos (Prosopis section Algarobia) may have been part of this transformation. Here, we provide evidence that these species were not native to the Atacama Desert of Chile (18–27S), appearing only in the late Holocene and most likely due to human actions. We assembled a database composed of 41 taxon specific AMS radiocarbon dates from archaeobotanical and palaeoecological records (rodent middens, leaf litter deposits), as well an extensive bibliographical review comprising archaeobotanical, paleoecological, phylogenetic and taxonomic data to evaluate the chronology of introduction and dispersal of these trees. Although Algarrobos could have appeared as early as 4200 yr BP in northernmost Chile, they only became common throughout the Atacama over a thousand years later, during and after the Formative period. Cultural and natural factors likely contributed to its spread and consolidation as a major silvicultural resource.

";2045-2322;"Chile hosts some of the sunniest places on earth, which has led to a growing solar energy industry in recent years. However, the lack of high resolution measurements of solar irradiance becomes a critical obstacle for both financing and design of solar installations. Besides the Atacama Desert, Chile displays a large array of ""solar climates"" due to large latitude and altitude variations, and so provides a useful testbed for the development of solar irradiance maps. Here a new public database for surface solar irradiance over Chile is presented. This database includes hourly irradiance from 2004 to 2016 at 90 m horizontal resolution over continental Chile. Our results are based on global reanalysis data to force a radiative transfer model for clear sky solar irradiance and an empirical model based on geostationary satellite data for cloudy conditions. The results have been validated using 140 surface solar irradiance stations throughout the country. Model mean percentage error in hourly time series of global horizontal irradiance is only 0.73%, considering both clear and cloudy days.

Evidence suggests that trash basket epiphytes (TBE) can be considered ecosystem engineers of forest canopies, due to their relationship with arboreal soil availability and treetop communities. Here we evaluated whether the TBE Fascicularia bicolor (Bromeliaceae), modulates temperature and humidity in the forest canopy. We also investigated if this bromeliad is related with greater arboreal soil accumulation and is associated to higher diversity of other epiphytic plants and invertebrates in the canopy of the South-American temperate rainforest (SATR), in Chile. We measured temperature and humidity in ten trees within the forest before and after the experimental addition of F. bicolor. We also related the presence of F. bicolor with occurrence of soil macrofauna and other canopy dwelling plants in a comparative field survey. Temperature variability in the canopy was reduced by F. bicolor. Soil availability was higher in siteswith mats of F. bicolor. The richness of vascular epiphytes was unaltered by the presence of F. bicolor,but species composition differed between sites with and without mats on each tree. At the group level,the cover of lichens and bryophytes was greater in sites without F. bicolor, while vascular epiphytes showa larger cover in sites with F. bicolor. The species richness of invertebrates increased in treetop sites colonized by F. bicolor but species composition was not different from soil in branch bifurcations. Our resultsshow that F. bicolor must be considered in forest management practices to determine which trees must belogged, in order to preserve the viability of populations of these key organisms in the treetops of South-American temperate rainforests.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112717302074;417-428;Vol.400;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this context, the role of the Andean highlands (3400 meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate. Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the high Andes constitutes an important “megapatch” that should be assessed in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology and technological processes involved are recognized over vast territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition, which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the Pacific coastal corridor.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040618216312368;;vol. in press;Thomson Reuters ISI

Considerando que muchas de las iglesias de Chiloé fueron construidas utilizando madera de Pilgerodendron uviferum, el objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar el potencial de esta especie para datar piezas de madera de dos de estas históricas construcciones: las iglesias de Vilupulli e Ichuac. En Vilupulli se dataron piezas de 311 y 181 años provenientes de los pilares de la torre. Estas piezas fueron fechadas con cronologías de ancho de anillos de P. uviferum cercanas a las dos iglesias. También utilizando estas cronologías se dataron piezas de 79, 89, 97 y 135 años obtenidas a partir de los pilotes que sostienen el piso de la iglesia de Ichuac. Considerando que Vilupulli fue construida a principios del siglo XX, es posible que las muestras de la torre que presentaron fechas cercanas a 1918, sean parte del proceso tardío de construcción de la iglesia o de una restauración posterior. Por su parte, Ichuac fue construida a finales del siglo XIX, por lo que las piezas del piso que dataron entre 19201929, formarían parte de una posible restauración no descrita previamente en archivos históricos, la cual pudo ocurrir incluso varios años posterior a la fecha del anillo más reciente encontrado en las piezas estudiadas.

This study addressed for the first time the three most frequent tree- ring anomalies recorded in the northern and oldest known Austrocedrus chilensis forest in central Chile (32-35°S). Three anatomic anomalies described were: partially absent rings, intra-annual bands and frost rings. Partially absent rings resulted from cambial inactivity during a complete growing period and require dendrochronological tools to be detected. Intra- annual bands are consequence of the abundance-shortage of environmental resources during the growing season and can be detected by examining the undefined late-wood boundaries. Frost rings, are caused by extreme low temperatures and are characterized by collapsed cells in the tree-ring growth. Results indicate that the northern most population exhibited the highest rate of absent rings, while the occurrence of intra-annual bands seems to be rather minor in the study area. Finally, frost rings are registered mainly in the younger trees in all three studied sites. These results suggest the potential for future spatio-temporal studies that examine the frequency of these anatomical anomalies in A. chilensis chronologies along its wide geographical distribution. This will complement the current environmental information recorded by its growth rates.;http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0717-66432017000200269&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en;269-281;vol.74 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI, ScieLO

That’s why the international negotiation related to the climate regime use the ambiguous term “loss and damage” to design the impacts related to climate change. 
The purpose of this article is to know if the term “loss and damage” is a useful one in view of reparation under international law or if it is necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion employed by the doctrine. More precisely, the central question is the following: why is it necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion? 
Even though “loss and damage” could formally be a legal concept, it is substantially useless with regard to reparation under international law because it is too ambiguous. 
Therefore, we judged necessary to clarify the concept of “climate change damage” used by the doctrine but that unfortunately defines it insufficiently. Indeed, it could be useful for the doctrine but also for the lawyers of vulnerable countries and the judges to dispose of a legal notion in order to consider the reparation of the damages related to climate change under international law.

These societies inhabited one of the world’s most productive marine environments flanked by one the world’s driest deserts. Both of these environments have witnessed significant ecological variation since people first colonized themat the end of the Pleistocene (c. 13,000 cal yr BP). Here, we examine the relationship between the relative abundance of shellfish (a staple resource) along a 9,500-year sequence of archeological shell midden accumulations at Caleta (a small inlet or cove) Vitor, with past demographic trends (established via summed probability distributions of radiocarbon ages) and technological innovations together with paleoceanographic data on past primary productivity. We find that shellfish extraction varied considerably from one cultural period to the next in terms of the number of species and their abundance, with diversity increasing during periods of regionally decreased productivity. Such shifts in consumption patterns are considered community based management decisions, and for the most part they were synchronous with large and unusual regional demographic fluctuations experienced by prehistoric coastal societies in northern Chile. When taken together with their technological innovations, our data illustrates how these human groups tailored their socio-cultural patterns to what were often abrupt and prolonged environmental changes throughout the Holocene.;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2017.00077/full;;vol.5;Thomson Reuters ISI

";"Implementation of methane cycling for deep time, global warming simulations with the DCESS Earth System Model (Version 1.2)
";"Geoscientific Model Development
";;10.5194/gmd-10-4081-2017;1991-9603;Geological records reveal a number of ancient, large and rapid negative excursions of the carbon-13 isotope. Such excursions can only be explained by massive injections of depleted carbon to the Earth system over a short duration. These injections may have forced strong global warming events, sometimes accompanied by mass extinctions such as the Triassic-Jurassic and end-Permian extinctions 201 and 252 million years ago, respectively. In many cases, evidence points to methane as the dominant form of injected carbon, whether as thermogenic methane formed by magma intrusions through overlying carbon-rich sediment or from warming-induced dissociation of methane hydrate, a solid compound of methane and water found in ocean sediments. As a consequence of the ubiquity and importance of methane in major Earth events, Earth system models for addressing such events should include a comprehensive treatment of methane cycling but such a treatment has often been lacking. Here we implement methane cycling in the Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) model, a simplified but well-tested Earth system model of intermediate complexity. We use a generic methane input function that allows variation in input type, size, timescale and ocean–atmosphere partition. To be able to treat such massive inputs more correctly, we extend the model to deal with ocean suboxic/anoxic conditions and with radiative forcing and methane lifetimes appropriate for high atmospheric methane concentrations. With this new model version, we carried out an extensive set of simulations for methane inputs of various sizes, timescales and ocean–atmosphere partitions to probe model behavior. We find that larger methane inputs over shorter timescales with more methane dissolving in the ocean lead to ever-increasing ocean anoxia with consequences for ocean life and global carbon cycling. Greater methane input directly to the atmosphere leads to more warming and, for example, greater carbon dioxide release from land soils. Analysis of synthetic sediment cores from the simulations provides guidelines for the interpretation of real sediment cores spanning the warming events. With this improved DCESS model version and paleo-reconstructions, we are now better armed to gauge the amounts, types, timescales and locations of methane injections driving specific, observed deep-time, global warming events.;https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4081/2017/;4081-4103;vol.10 is.11;Thomson Reuters ISI

Closed‐canopy deciduous Nothofagus forests have dominated the region with little variation until the arrival of Chilean–European settlers, suggesting a predominance of cool‐temperate and wet conditions. Within this state we identify centennial‐scale episodes of forest fragmentation, increase in littoral macrophytes and volcanic/paleofire disturbance between 2700 and 3000 cal a BP, 2200 and 2500 cal a BP and over the last ∼250 years, which we interpret as intervals with negative hydrologic balance. Natural variability caused little impact on the physiognomy and composition of the vegetation in pre‐European time, in contrast to the accelerated shift that started during the late 19th century associated with deforestation, homogenization and synchronization of ecosystem changes at the landscape level, and spread of exotic plant species brought by Chilean and European settlers during a warm/dry interval. The resilience of deciduous Nothofagus forests to natural disturbance regimes and climate change was exceeded by large‐scale human disturbance since the late 19th century by fire, timber exploitation and livestock grazing. These disturbances caused an ecosystem shift towards artificial meadows and scrublands with frequent high‐magnitude fires.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jqs.2948;845-856;vol.32 is.6;Thomson Reuters ISI

Previous analyses focus solely on the former, which implicitly assumes that climate-induced changes in consumption do not affect price. But this assumption is untenable because a shift in demand alters quantity and price at equilibrium. Here we present the first empirical estimates for the effect of climate change on electricity prices. Translated through the merit order dispatch of existing capacity for generating electricity, climate-induced changes in daily and monthly patterns of electricity consumption cause non-linear changes in electricity prices. A 2 °C increase in global mean temperature increases the prices for and consumption of electricity in Massachusetts USA, such that the average household’s annual expenditures on electricity increase by about 12%. Commercial customers incur a 9% increase. These increases are caused largely by higher prices for electricity, whose impacts on expenditures are 1.3 and 3.6 fold larger than changes in residential and commercial consumption, respectively. This suggests that previous empirical studies understate the effects of climate change on electricity expenditures and that policy may be needed to ensure that the market generates investments in peaking capacity to satisfy climate-driven changes in summer-time consumption.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030142151730157X;01/11/18;vol.106;Thomson Reuters ISI

The microbial mat community included 31 phyla, of which only Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant. At 58 degrees C both phyla co-occurred, with similar contributions in relative abundances in metagenomes and total transcriptional activity. At 66 degrees C, filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic Chloroflexi were >90% responsible for the total transcriptional activity recovered, while Cyanobacteria contributed most metagenomics and metatranscriptomics reads at 48 degrees C. According to such reads, phototrophy was carried out both through oxygenic photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria (mostly Mastigocladus) and anoxygenic phototrophy due mainly to Chloroflexi. Inorganic carbon assimilation through the Calvin-Benson cycle was almost exclusively due to Mastigocladus, which was the main primary producer at lower temperatures. Two other CO2 fixation pathways were active at certain times and temperatures as indicated by transcripts: 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) bi-cycle due to Chloroflexi and 3-hydroxypropionate-4-hydroxybutyrate (HH) cycle carried out by Thaumarchaeota. The active transcription of the genes involved in these C-fixation pathways correlated with high in situ determined carbon fixation rates. In situ measurements of ammonia assimilation and nitrogen fixation (exclusively attributed to Cyanobacteria and mostly to Mastigocladus sp.) showed these were the most important nitrogen acquisition pathways at 58 and 48 degrees C. At 66 degrees C ammonia oxidation genes were actively transcribed (mostly due to Thaumarchaeota). Reads indicated that denitrification was present as a nitrogen sink at all temperatures and that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) contributed very little.

This study presents evidence that winds favorable to upwelling have increased within the southern boundary of the Humboldt Current System (35°–42°S) in recent decades. This trend is consistent with a poleward movement of the influence of the Southeast Pacific Anticyclone and resembles the spatial pattern projected by Global Circulation Models for warming scenarios. Chlorophyll a levels (from 2002 to present) determined by satellite and field-based time-series observations show a positive trend, mainly in austral spring–summer (December–January–February), potentially explained by observed increments in nutrient flux towards surface waters and photosynthetically active radiation. Both parameters appear to respond to alongshore wind stress and cloud cover in the latitudinal range of 35°S to 42°S. In addition, net annual deepening of the mixed layer depth is estimated using density and temperature profiles. Changes in this depth are associated with increasing winds and may explain cooler, more saline, and more productive surface waters, with the latter potentially causing fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and other gases, such as nitrous oxide, sensitive to changes in oxygenation. We argue that these recent changes represent, at least in part, a regional manifestation of the Anthropocene along the Chilean coast.";https://www.elementascience.org/article/10.1525/elementa.314/;593-605;Vol.6 is.1;Thomson  Reuters ISI

";"In the Porcelana Hot Spring (Northern Patagonia), true-branching cyanobacteria are the dominant primary producers in microbial mats, and they are mainly responsible for carbon and nitrogen fixation. However, little is known about their metabolic and genomic adaptations at high temperatures. Therefore, in this study, a total of 81 Fischerella thermalis strains (also known as Mastigocladus laminosus) were isolated from mat samples in a thermal gradient between 61–46 °C. The complementary use of proteomic comparisons from these strains, and comparative genomics of F. thermalis pangenomes, suggested that at least two different ecotypes were present within these populations. MALDI-TOF MS analysis separated the strains into three clusters; two with strains obtained from mats within the upper temperature range (61 and 54 °C), and a third obtained from mats within the lower temperature range (51 and 46 °C). Both groups possessed different but synonymous nifH alleles. The main proteomic differences were associated with the abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins. Three F. thermalis metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were described from 66, 58 and 48 °C metagenomes. These pangenomes indicated a divergence of orthologous genes and a high abundance of exclusive genes at 66 °C. These results improved the current understanding of thermal adaptation of F. thermalis and the evolution of these thermophilic cyanobacterial species.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0723202018302297;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

This study proposes an easy-to-apply spatial method of watershed vulnerability evaluation using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the Andalién River watershed, located in the Chilean mediterranean. A watershed vulnerability index (WVI) based on three sub-indices – anthropogenic stressors, environmental fragility and natural disturbances – was developed. To determine the index grouping weights, expert surveys were carried out using the Delphi method. We subsequently normalized and integrated the factors of each sub-index with relative weights. The ranges of each thematic layer were re-classified to establish vulnerability scores. The watershed was divided into three sections: headwaters zone, transfer zone and depositional zone. The watershed vulnerability index showed that 41% of the watershed had very low vulnerability and 42% had medium vulnerability, while only 1% – in the depositional zone – had high vulnerability. A one-way ANOVA was carried out to analyze the vulnerability differences among the three sections of the watershed; it showed significant differences (F (2, 16) = 8.15: p < 0.05). The a posteriori test showed differences between the headwaters and depositional zones (Tukey test, p = 0.005) and between the transfer and depositional zones (Tukey test, p = 0.014). To validate the WVI, water quality was measured at 16 stations in the watershed; there was a significant correlation between vulnerability level and NO2 − levels (r = 0.8; p = 0.87; α = 0.05) and pH (r = 0.8; p = 0.80; α = 0.05).

Location: Araucanía region in the western Andean Range of south-central Chile where fire occurred during the 2001–2002 season. Methods: Sampling of prefire stand structure and postfire vegetation response was performed along a burn severity gradient a decade after the fire. We evaluated the relationship between field-measured tree mortality and satellite-derived burn severity using a generalized linear model. We fit zero-inflated mixture models to regeneration data of each genus to assess the importance of abiotic variables, stand characteristics, and biotic interactions. Results: The relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio explained 85% of the variability in canopy mortality. Nearly 12,000 hectares burned; the majority at high severity (67%). Regeneration densities of both genera were lower at higher levels of burn severity and higher with greater total basal area (live, dead, and down trees). The relative effect size of burn severity on regeneration was nearly twice as large for Nothofagus, which suggests information legacies of Araucaria have cascading effects on postdisturbance material legacies. Main conclusions: Araucaria-Nothofagus mortality from wildfire can be readily mapped using satellite-derived burn severity. Although environmental site characteristics and biotic interactions mediate regeneration, basal area, and burn severity are the main mechanisms controlling regeneration. Forest refugia and postfire regeneration are vulnerable to recurrent fire. Therefore, we expect future fire (either increased severity or frequency), driven by landscape level changes, as a potential mechanism that can reduce local resilience of these forests as initial postfire material legacies (e.g., refugia and regeneration) are removed from the landscape. Our findings highlight an approach to quantify important attributes of forest disturbance and refugia, and identify areas for monitoring postdisturbance regeneration as the forests throughout south-central Chile and Argentina face a multitude of potential change agents.";http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jbi.13428;;;Thomson  Reuters ISI

";0169-8095;"In developing countries, an accurate representation of the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall is currently severely limited, therefore, satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) are promising alternatives. In this work, six state-of-the-art SREs (TRMM 3B42v7, TRMM 3B42RT, CHIRPSv2, CMORPHv1, PERSIANN-CDR, and MSWEPv2) are evaluated over three different basins in Latin-America, using a point-to-pixel comparison at daily, monthly, and seasonal timescales. Three continuous (root mean squared error, modified Kling-Gupta efficiency, and percent bias) and three categorical (probability of detection, false alarm ratio, and frequency bias) indices are used to evaluate the performance of the different SREs, and to assess if the upscaling procedure used, in CHIRPSv2 and MSWEPv2, to enable a consistent point-to-pixel comparison affects the evaluation of the SREs performance at different time scales.

Our results show that for Paraiba do Sul in Brazil, MSWEPv2 presented the best performance at daily and monthly time scales, while CHIRPSv2 performed the best at these timescales over the Magdalena River Basin in Colombia. In the Imperial River Basin in Chile, MSWEPv2 and CHIRPSv2 performed the best at daily and monthly time scales, respectively. When the basins were evaluated at seasonal scale, CMORPHv1 performed the best for DJF and SON, TRMM 3B42v7 for MAM, and PERSIANN-CDR for JJA over Imperial Basin. MSWEPv2 performed the best over Paraiba do Sul Basin for all seasons and CHIRPSv2 showed the best performance over Magdalena Basin. The Modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE′) proved to be a useful evaluation index because it decomposes the performance of the SREs into linear correlation, bias, and variability parameters, while the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is not recommended for evaluating SREs performance because it gives more weight to high rainfall events and its results are not comparable between areas with different precipitation regimes.

On the other hand, CHIRPSv2 and MSWEPv2 presented different performance, for some study areas and time scales, when evaluated with their original spatial resolution (0.05° and 0.1, respectively) with respect to the evaluation resulting after applying the spatial upscaling (to a unified 0.25), showing that the upscaling procedure might impact the SRE performance. We finally conclude that a site-specific validation is needed before using any SRE, and we recommend to evaluate the SRE performance before and after applying any upscaling procedure in order to select the SRE that best represents the spatio-temporal precipitation patterns of a site.";http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169809517313029;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.;http://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat8785;eaat8785;vol.4 is.9;Thomson  Reuters ISI

However, scarcity of observed data records increases the difficulty of planning future water supply. Instrumental records suggest a reduction in streamflow over the last 56 years. However, this change is not statistically significant and the lack of meteorological stations with long records in this mountainous region hampers a deeper analysis, motivating the use of tree rings to analyse whether these changes are part of a long-term trend. This work represents the first high-elevation runoff reconstruction in Chile using 300 years of tree ring chronologies of Araucaria araucana and Astroceudrus chilensis. The upper part of Biobío river melting season runoff (October–March) and pluvial season runoff (April–September) was reconstructed and analysed to investigate the influence of large-scale climatic drivers on runoff generation, current drought trends and to improve the understanding of climate variability in this region. We obtained positive correlations between the 20-year moving average of reconstructed pluvial season runoff and reconstructed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which is indicative of multi-decadal variability. We also found a negative correlation between the 11-year moving average of reconstructed melting season runoff and the PDO and positive correlations with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Important differences in the runoff variability of the upper and the lower part of the catchment were identified which are in part led by the influence of the large-scale climatic features that drive runoff generation in both regions. We found that the changes observed in the instrumental records are part of multi-decadal cycles led by the PDO and SAM for pluvial season runoff and melting season runoff, respectively.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/joc.5186;436-451;vol.38 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

This development is due to growing interest from a diverse set of stakeholders, such as air quality regulatory bodies, aviation and military authorities, solar energy plant managers, climate services providers, and health professionals. Owing to the complexity of atmospheric aerosol processes and their sensitivity to the underlying meteorological conditions, the prediction of aerosol particle concentrations and properties in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) framework faces a number of challenges. The modeling of numerous aerosol-related parameters increases computational expense. Errors in aerosol prediction concern all processes involved in the aerosol life cycle including (a) errors on the source terms (for both anthropogenic and natural emissions), (b) errors directly dependent on the meteorology (e.g., mixing, transport, scavenging by precipitation), and (c) errors related to aerosol chemistry (e.g., nucleation, gas-aerosol partitioning, chemical transformation and growth, hygroscopicity). Finally, there are fundamental uncertainties and significant processing overhead in the diverse observations used for verification and assimilation within these systems. Indeed, a significant component of aerosol forecast development consists in streamlining aerosol-related observations and reducing the most important errors through model development and data assimilation. Aerosol particle observations from satellite- and ground-based platforms have been crucial to guide model development of the recent years and have been made more readily available for model evaluation and assimilation. However, for the sustainability of the aerosol particle prediction activities around the globe, it is crucial that quality aerosol observations continue to be made available from different platforms (space, near surface, and aircraft) and freely shared. This paper reviews current requirements for aerosol observations in the context of the operational activities carried out at various global and regional centers. While some of the requirements are equally applicable to aerosol-climate, the focus here is on global operational prediction of aerosol properties such as mass concentrations and optical parameters. It is also recognized that the term ""requirements"" is loosely used here given the diversity in global aerosol observing systems and that utilized data are typically not from operational sources. Most operational models are based on bulk schemes that do not predict the size distribution of the aerosol particles. Others are based on a mix of ""bin"" and bulk schemes with limited capability of simulating the size information. However the next generation of aerosol operational models will output both mass and number density concentration to provide a more complete description of the aerosol population. A brief overview of the state of the art is provided with an introduction on the importance of aerosol prediction activities. The criteria on which the requirements for aerosol observations are based are also outlined. Assimilation and evaluation aspects are discussed from the perspective of the user requirements.";https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/10615/2018/;10615-10643;vol.18 is.14;Thomson Reuters ISI

We studied the event using surface station data, satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and numerical simulations. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Antarctic Ice Shelf Image Archive provides clear evidence for disintegration and advection of sea ice, as well as the formation of melt ponds on the ice sheet surface at the base of the AP mountain range. A deep low‐pressure center over the Amundsen‐Bellingshausen Sea and a blocking ridge over the southeast Pacific provided favorable conditions for the development of an atmospheric river with a northwest‐southeast orientation, directing warm and moist air toward the AP, and triggering a widespread foehn episode. A control simulation using a regional climate model shows the existence of local topographically induced warming along the northern tip of the AP (∼60% of the full temperature signal) and the central part of the eastern AP (>90% of the full temperature signal) with respect to a simulation without topography. These modeling results suggest that more than half of the warming experienced at Esperanza can be attributed to the foehn effect (a local process), rather than to the large‐scale advection of warm air from the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, the local foehn effect also has a large‐scale advection component, since the atmospheric river provides water vapor for orographic precipitation enhancement and latent heat release, which makes it difficult to completely disentangle the role of local versus large‐scale processes in explaining the extreme event.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017JD027796;3871-3892;vol.123 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

We analyzed this diurnal streamflow signal (DSS), which appeared mid-spring (in the growing season). The end of this DSS coincided with a sustained rain event in autumn, which deeply affected stream and meteorological variables. A survey along the stream revealed that the DSS maximum and minimum values appeared 6 and 4 hours earlier, respectively, at headwaters located in the mountain forests/ plantations than at the control point in the swamp forest. Et in the swamp forest was higher in the morning and in the late afternoon, but this process could not influence the groundwater stage. Trees in the mountain headwaters reached their maximum Ets in the early morning and/or close to midday. Our results suggest that the DSS is a wave that moves from forests high in the mountains towards lowland areas, where Et is decoupled from the DSS. This signal delay seems to convert the link between streamflow and Et in an apparent, but spurious positive relationship.

Here, we assess the stationarity of SAM spatial correlations with instrumental and paleoclimate proxy data for the past millennium. The instrumental period shows that temporal non-stationarities in SAM teleconnections are
not consistent across the SH land areas. This suggests that the influence of the SAM index is modulated by regional effects.
However, within key-regions with good proxy data coverage (South America, Tasmania, New Zealand), teleconnections are mostly stationary over the instrumental period. Using different stationarity criteria for proxy record selection, we provide
new austral summer and annual mean SAM index reconstructions over the last millennium. Our summer SAM reconstructions are very robust to changes in proxy record selection and the selection of the calibration period, particularly on the multi-decadal timescale. In contrast, the weaker performance and lower agreement in the annual mean SAM reconstructions
point towards changing teleconnection patterns that may be particularly important outside the summer months. Our results clearly portend that the temporal stationarity of the proxy-climate relationships should be taken into account in the design of comprehensive regional and hemispherical climate reconstructions. The summer SAM reconstructions show no significant relationship to solar, greenhouse gas and volcanic forcing, with the exception of an extremely strong negative anomaly following the AD 1257 Samalas eruption. Furthermore, reconstructed pre-industrial summer SAM trends are very similar to
trends obtained by model control simulations. We find that recent trends in the summer SAM lie outside the 5–95% range of pre-industrial natural variability.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00382-017-4015-0;1-19;;Thomson Reuters ISI

National authorities identified the relevant effects of the wildfires on infrastructure and ecosystems. However, other indirect effects such as the risk of flooding or, increased air pollution were not assessed. The present study assesses: i) the geographic characterization of wildfires, ii) amount of damage to ecosystems and the severity of wildfires, iii) the effects of megafires on air quality in nearby and distant urban areas, and iv) identification of cities potentially exposed to landslides and flooding. We ran remote sensing analyses based on the Normalized Burn Ratio taken from Landsat imagery, “active fires” from MODIS, and ASTER GDEM. The particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) levels measured on 34 Chilean's municipalities were correlated with the burning area/distance ratio by Spearman correlation. Socionatural hazards were evaluated using multi-criteria analyses combining proximity to burned areas, severity, potential flow of water and sediments as indicated by the Digital Elevation Model, drainage networks and the location of human settlements. 91 burned areas were identified, covering 529,794 ha. The most affected ecosystems were forest plantations and native shrublands. We found significant correlations between burned area/distance ratios and PM2.5 and PM10 levels, leading to increased levels over the Chilean air quality standard in the most populated cities. 37 human settlements were at increased risk of landslides and flooding hazards after fires and eleven could now be characterized as dangerously exposed. The 2017 wildfires in Chile have had an impact at both a small and large scale, with far-reaching air pollutants dispersing and affecting >74% of the Chilean population. The impact of the wildfires was also extended over time, creating future potential for landslides and flooding, with the risk increasing in rainy seasons.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969718317601;1526-1536;vol.637-638;Thomson Reuters ISI

Here, the stratocumulus clouds meet the Coastal Cordillera, producing highly dynamic advective marine fog, a major feature of the local climate that provides water to a hyper-arid environment. One of the main issues that arises in harvesting fog water is our limited understanding of the spatial and inter-annual variability of fog clouds and their associated water content. Here we assess the role of regional-wide El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing on local inter-annual fog-water yields along the coast of Atacama. We contrast 17 years of continuous fog-water data, with local and regional atmospheric and oceanographic variables to determine the link between them and the inter-annual dynamics of fog in northern Chile. Sea surface temperature (SST) in ENSO zone 1 + 2 shows significant correlations with offshore and coastal Atacama SST, as well as with local low cloud cover and fog water yields, which go beyond the annual cycle beat, exposing a potential causal link and influence of ENSO on fog along the Atacama. On the inter-annual time scale, we found that when ENSO 3 + 4 zone SST, specifically during summer, overcome a > 1°C temperature threshold, they incite significantly higher summer fog water yields and explain 79% of the fog variability. Furthermore, satellite images displaying regional extent Sc cloud and fog presence during ENSO extremes reveal higher cloud abundance during El Niño at this latitude. However, 75% of the yearly fog water is collected during winter, and does not appear to be affected in a significant manner by Pacific oscillations. Thus, our results suggest that the utilization of fog as a fresh water resource may be sustainable in the future, regardless of ENSO-induced variability in the region.;http://www.aaqr.org/doi/10.4209/aaqr.2017.01.0022;127-144;vol.18 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

A narrow range of N2O concentrations were observed from under-saturations (∼65%), as result of freshwater/glacial flow into fjord heads, to slight super-saturations (∼120–150%) in fjord mouths and adjacent marine zones. One exception was Otway Sound, where a penguin colony is situated, with N2O levels of up to 218%. In contrast, CH4 concentrations presented a wide range of saturations between 47.9% and 483%, with a spatial distribution that mainly corresponded to the type of hydrographic/geomorphologic basin; in the southern Patagonian Andes (mostly covered by the southern Ice Fields) CH4 levels varied between 65 and 80% in the marine area, and 180% saturation in the channels and fjords; whereas in the southern Patagonian tableland (Magellan Strait) higher CH4 concentrations, up to 483% saturation, were observed apparently associated with continental inputs (peatland and tundra vegetation). N2O concentrations were positively correlated with salinity and nutrients, indicating that the majority of N2O and nutrients (except silicate) originated from the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), which mixes with N2O-depleated freshwater.

This dynamic is observed in central Chile's coastal upwelling system (36 °S), which presents seasonally O2 deficient waters and high biological productivity. Temporal dynamics for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO3−, NO2− and NH4+) are analyzed based on a ten year time series of monthly measurements of DO and DIN and a three year record of absolute DIN uptake rates (ρDIN), respective turnover rates (νDIN), and O2 utilization rates (OUR). Observed O2 deficit gradually increases from hypoxia to near anoxia as the system becomes more productive, favoring the accumulation of NO2− and NH4+. Three temporal phases within the aphotic layer were distinguished: (I) DO > 62 μmol L−1 (May to August), (II) 5 < DO < 62 μmol L−1 (September to December) and (III) DO < 5 μmol L−1 (January to April). From phase I to III, DO and NO3− inventories decreased by eight and two times, respectively, while NH4+ and NO2 inventories increased two- and five-fold, respectively. Uptake rates for NH4+ varied from 0.23 to 450 nmol N L−1 d−1 and from 1.42 to 184 nmol N L−1 d−1 for NO3−. Notably, integrated ρNH4+ increased during phase III, generating a NH4+ turnover time of 12–29 days; whereas integrated ρNO3− peaked during phase II, and removed the NO3− pool over an extended turnover time (>820 days). Integrated OUR gradually increased from phase I to III (from 225 to 422 mmol m−2 d−1), with DO pools replenished over 2.3 to 26 days. NH4+ regeneration rates ranged from 34 to 62 mmol m−2 d−1 and NH4+ pools were replenished within a few days. Variation in DO, which regulates N cycling, may explain the accumulation of N-species within the aphotic layer.

They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4–9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3–34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW.

A meta-analysis for the oligotrophic CAO showed a pattern with Flavobacteriia dominating in melt ponds, Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria in solid ice cores, Flavobacteriia, Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in brine, and Alphaproteobacteria in SW. Based on our results, we expect that the roles of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the CAO will increase with global warming owing to the increased production of meltwater in summer.

Results from the instrumental streamflow record ( ∼  1940 onwards) indicated that the hydrological regime is fundamentally pluvial with a small snowmelt contribution during spring, and evidenced a decreasing trend, both for the summer and the full annual record. The reconstruction showed that streamflow below the average characterized the post-1980 period, with more frequent, but not more intense, drought episodes. We additionally found that the recent positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode has significantly influenced streamflow. These findings agree with previous studies, suggesting a robust regional signal and a shift to a new hydrological scenario.

";"New insights into the use of stable water isotopes at the northern Antarctic Peninsula as a tool for regional climate studies
";"The Cryosphere
";;10.5194/tc-12-1069-2018;"1994-0424
";Due to recent atmospheric and oceanic warming, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most challenging regions of Antarctica to understand in terms of both local- and regional-scale climate signals. Steep topography and a lack of long-term and in situ meteorological observations complicate the extrapolation of existing climate models to the sub-regional scale. Therefore, new techniques must be developed to better understand processes operating in the region. Isotope signals are traditionally related mainly to atmospheric conditions, but a detailed analysis of individual components can give new insight into oceanic and atmospheric processes. This paper aims to use new isotopic records collected from snow and firn cores in conjunction with existing meteorological and oceanic datasets to determine changes at the climatic scale in the northern extent of the Antarctic Peninsula. In particular, a discernible effect of sea ice cover on local temperatures and the expression of climatic modes, especially the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), is demonstrated. In years with a large sea ice extension in winter (negative SAM anomaly), an inversion layer in the lower troposphere develops at the coastal zone. Therefore, an isotope–temperature relationship (δ–T) valid for all periods cannot be obtained, and instead the δ–T depends on the seasonal variability of oceanic conditions. Comparatively, transitional seasons (autumn and spring) have a consistent isotope–temperature gradient of +0.69 ‰ °C−1. As shown by firn core analysis, the near-surface temperature in the northern-most portion of the Antarctic Peninsula shows a decreasing trend (−0.33 °C year−1) between 2008 and 2014. In addition, the deuterium excess (dexcess) is demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of seasonal oceanic conditions, and therefore suitable to improve a firn age model based on seasonal dexcess variability. The annual accumulation rate in this region is highly variable, ranging between 1060 and 2470 kg m−2 year−1 from 2008 to 2014. The combination of isotopic and meteorological data in areas where data exist is key to reconstruct climatic conditions with a high temporal resolution in polar regions where no direct observations exist.;https://www.the-cryosphere.net/12/1069/2018/;1069-1090;"vol.12 is.3

Reconstructed SST from modern F. maxima shells were related to SST obtained from in situ thermometers, supporting the use of this mollusc species as a paleotemperature archive. Mean SST reconstructed from Early Holocene archaeological shells (14.13 °C) was 2.86 °C cooler than mean temperature recorded in modern shells (16.99 °C). Mean SST reconstructed from modern shells was ~1.04 °C warmer than the mean temperature of in situ thermometers (15.95°C). Hence the paleo–SST data from archaeological sites 224A and Paposo Norte 9 enrich the Early Holocene nearshore paleoceanographic scenario of the Pacific coast of South America, with mean SST cooler than present-day SST. Our results validate the use of F. maxima shells as a SST proxy and contribute to a better understanding of the latitudinal distribution of the coastal upwelling regime during the Early Holocene, temporal changes in the structure of the Humboldt Current along the Holocene, and its influence on human adaptation through the prehistory of South America.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S003101821730874X;22-34;vol.499;Thomson Reuters ISI

When populations synchronize, adverse changes in ecosystems and social systems may cascade from society to society. Thus, to develop policies that favor the sustained use of resources, we must understand the processes that cause the synchrony of human populations. To date, it is not clear whether human societies display long-term synchrony or, if they do, the potential causes. Our analysis begins to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the long-term synchrony of human societies, and we hypothesize that the synchrony of human populations results from (i) the creation of social ties that couple populations over smaller scales and (ii) much larger scale, globally convergent trajectories of cultural evolution toward more energy-consuming political economies with higher carrying capacities. Our results suggest that the process of globalization is a natural consequence of evolutionary trajectories that increase the carrying capacities of human societies.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1802859115;9962-9967;vol.115 is.40;Thomson  Reuters ISI

Surface water in Chile Bay (Greenwich Island, South Shetlands) is influenced by freshwater from the melting of sea ice and surrounding glaciers; however, it is not a widely studied system. The phyto- and bacterioplankton communities in Chile Bay were studied over two consecutive summers; during a low productivity period (chlorophyll a &lt; 0.05 mg m−3) and an ascendant phototrophic bloom (chlorophyll a up to 2.38 mg m−3). Microbial communities were analyzed by 16S rRNA—including plastidial—gene sequencing. Diatoms (mainly Thalassiosirales) were the most abundant phytoplankton, particularly during the ascendant bloom. Bacterioplankton in the low productivity period was less diverse and dominated by a few operational taxonomic units (OTUs), related to Colwellia and Pseudoalteromonas. Alpha diversity was higher during the bloom, where several Bacteroidetes taxa absent in the low productivity period were present. Network analysis indicated that phytoplankton relative abundance was correlated with bacterioplankton phylogenetic diversity and the abundance of several bacterial taxa. Hubs—the most connected OTUs in the network—were not the most abundant OTUs and included some poorly described taxa in Antarctica, such as Neptunomonas and Ekhidna. In summary, the results of this study indicate that in Antarctic Peninsula coastal waters, such as Chile Bay, higher bacterioplankton community diversity occurs during a phototrophic bloom. This is likely a result of primary production, providing a source of fresh organic matter to bacterioplankton. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00300-018-2411-5;;;Thomson  Reuters ISI

We show evidence of how technological measures (e.g., fuel quality, three-way catalytic converters, diesel particle filters) have been successful in decreasing coarse mode aerosol (PM10) concentrations in Santiago despite increasing urbanization (e.g., population, motorization, urban sprawl). However, we also show that such measures will likely be insufficient if behavioral changes do not achieve an increase in the use of public transportation.

It is proposed that a remotely forced, sustained weakening of the free tropospheric westerly flow impinging the subtropical Andes leads to a relaxation of the southeasterly (SE) trades off the coast, which in turn may have warmed the eastern Pacific throughout the weakening of upwelling in a near-coastal band and the lessening of the evaporative cooling farther offshore.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/joc.5426;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

";"Traditionally a temperate and hyper-humid region, western Patagonia experienced its most severe drought during the summer and fall of 2016. Along with precipitation deficits larger than 50% there was a similar reduction in river discharge into coastal waters, a decline in vegetation productivity, excessive solar radiation at the surface, and frequent upwelling-favorable wind events offshore. The combination of these regional-scale anomalies seems to have set the stage for environmental disturbances that, although not new in western Patagonia, occurred with unprecedented magnitude, including severe urban air pollution episodes, large forest fires, and the worst ever recorded harmful algae bloom (HAB). The local climate anomalies were in turn related to the concomitant strong El Niño (through atmospheric teleconnections) and, to a lesser extent, anthropogenic climate change mediated by the positive polarity of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and internal variability, as both modes weakened the westerlies. Dryer than present conditions are consistently projected for northern Patagonia during the 21st century as a consequence of anthropogenic increases in radiative forcing; superposition of El Niño events in this altered climate may result in a higher frequency of extreme droughts and environmental disruptions like those observed in 2016.";http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v74/n3/p217-229/;217-229;vol.74 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

Results corroborate a misalignment of the climate change agenda and the ATS, stemming from the divergent views displayed by a wide network of actors.

A well-documented mechanism is the germination stimulated by fire-related cues, such as heat shock and smoke. However, less is known about the role of inhibitory germination signals (e.g. allelopathy) in regulating post-fire recruitment. Plant leachates derived from the unburned vegetation can enforce dormancy by means of allelopathic compounds, acting as a signal of unfavourable (highly 
competitive) niche for germination in pyrophyte species. Here, we assessed the separate effects of heat shock and plant leachates on seed germination of Drosophyllum lusitanicum , an endangered carnivorous plant endemic to Mediterranean fire-prone heathlands. We performed a germination experiment in which seeds were subjected to three treatments: (1) 5 min at 100◦C, (2) watering with plant leachate, and (3) control. Germination rate and seed viability was determined after 63 days. Heat shock stimulated seed germination in D. lusitanicum while plant leachates had inhibitory germination effects without reducing seed viability. Thus, both positive and negative signals could be involved in its successful post-fire recruitment. Fire would break seed dormancy and stimulate seed germination of D. lusitanicum through high temperatures, but also by eliminating allelochemical compounds from the soil. These results help to understand the population dynamics patterns found for D. lusitanicum in natural populations, and highlight the role of fire in the ecology and conservation of this endangered species. Seed dormancy imposed by plant-derived leachates as an adaptive mechanism should be considered more in fire ecology theory.";https://www.web-ecol.net/18/7/2018/;7-13;vol.18 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

Comparison of GIS-based top-down methodologies;Atmospheric Environment;;10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.049;1352-2310;Emission data is an essential tool for understanding environmental problems associated with sources and dynamics of air pollutants in urban environments, especially those emitted from vehicular sources. There is a lack of knowledge about the estimation of air pollutant emissions and particularly its spatial and temporal distribution in South America, mainly in medium-sized cities with population less than one million inhabitants. This work performed the spatial and temporal disaggregation of the on-road vehicle emission inventory (EI) in the medium-sized Andean city of Manizales, Colombia, with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h. A reported top-down methodology, based on the analysis of traffic flow levels and road network distribution, was applied. Results obtained allowed the identification of several hotspots of emission at the downtown zone and the residential and commercial area of Manizales. Downtown exhibited the highest percentage contribution of emissions normalized by its total area, with values equal to 6% and 5% of total CO and PM10 emissions per km2 respectively. These indexes were higher than those obtained in residential-commercial area with values of 2%/km2 for both pollutants. Temporal distribution showed strong relationship with driving patterns at rush hours, as well as an important influence of passenger cars and motorcycles in emissions of CO both at downtown and residential-commercial areas, and the impact of public transport in PM10 emissions in the residential-commercial zone. Considering that detailed information about traffic counts and road network distribution is not always available in medium-sized cities, this work compares other simplified top-down methods for spatially assessing the on-road vehicle EI. Results suggested that simplified methods could underestimate the spatial allocation of downtown emissions, a zone dominated by high traffic of vehicles. The comparison between simplified methods based on total traffic counts and road density distribution suggested that the use of total traffic counts in a simplified form could enhance higher uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation of emissions. Results obtained could add new information that help to improve the air pollution management system in the city and contribute to local public policy decisions. Additionally, this work provides appropriate resolution emission fluxes for ongoing research in atmospheric modeling in the city, with the aim to improve the understanding of transport, transformation and impacts of pollutant emissions in urban air quality.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1352231018300633;142-155;vol.179;Thomson Reuters ISI

These viruses can be readily isolated from marine and fresh waters environments; however, their presence in cosmopolitan thermophilic phototrophic mats remains largely unknown. This study investigates the morphological diversity (TEM), taxonomic composition (metagenomics), and active infectivity (metatranscriptomics) of viral communities over a thermal gradient in hot spring phototrophic mats from Northern Patagonia (Chile). The mats were dominated (up to 53%) by cosmopolitan thermophilic filamentous true-branching cyanobacteria from the genus Mastigocladus, the associated viral community was predominantly composed of Caudovirales (70%), with most of the active infections driven by cyanophages (up to 90% of Caudovirales transcripts). Metagenomic assembly lead to the first full genome description of a T7-like Thermophilic Cyanophage recovered from a hot spring (Porcelana Hot Spring, Chile), with a temperature of 58°C (TC-CHP58). This could potentially represent a world-wide thermophilic lineage of podoviruses that infect cyanobacteria. In the hot spring, TC-CHP58 was active over a temperature gradient from 48 to 66°C, showing a high population variability represented by 1979 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). TC-CHP58 was associated to the Mastigocladus spp. by CRISPR spacers. Marked differences in metagenomic CRISPR loci number and spacers diversity, as well as SNVs, in the TC-CHP58 proto-spacers at different temperatures, reinforce the theory of co-evolution between natural virus populations and cyanobacterial hosts. Considering the importance of cyanobacteria in hot spring biogeochemical cycles, the description of this new cyanopodovirus lineage may have global implications for the functioning of these extreme ecosystems.";https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02039/full;;vol.9;Thomson  Reuters ISI

They provide important information not only for climate and weather studies but also for urban planning and environmental health protection. We developed an open-source model (called Vehicular Emissions Inventory-VEIN v0.2.2) that provides high-resolution vehicular emissions inventories for different fields of studies. We focused on vehicular sources at street and hourly levels due to the current lack of information about these sources, mainly in developing countries. The type of emissions covered by VEIN are exhaust (hot and cold) and evaporative considering the deterioration of the factors. VEIN also performs speciation and incorporates functions to generate and spatially allocate emissions databases. It allows users to load their own emission factors, but it also provides emission factors from the road transport model (Copert), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Brazilian databases. The VEIN model reads, distributes by age of use and extrapolates hourly traffic data, and it estimates emissions hourly and spatially. Based on our knowledge, VEIN is the first bottom-up vehicle emissions software that allows input to the WRF-Chem model. Therefore, the VEIN model provides an important, easy and fast way of elaborating or analyzing vehicular emissions inventories under different scenarios. The VEIN results can be used as an input for atmospheric models, health studies, air quality standardizations and decision making.;https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/11/2209/2018/;2209-2229;vol.11;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, a sense of frustration persists regarding efforts to increase the use of science for decision-making. Regulations of copper smelter arsenic emissions developed in Chile during the 1990s represent a successful example of science informing policy making. The case involved production and use of local science in contrast to the common practice of copying international ambient standards. 
In this paper, we investigate arsenic regulation in Chile in the 1990s and focus on the role of the major science intervention during the process, project FONDEF2-24. The case is examined through the lens of knowledge governance (van Kerkhoff and Pilbeam, 2017). This theoretically-oriented approach guides our critical reflection on the relationship between knowledge and policy making, taking into consideration the formal and informal rules that shape the intervention and the underlying social and cultural patterns. The success of the science intervention’s influence on policy is better understood with such a perspective. 
We expand the knowledge governance approach by scrutinizing the relations of coherence between levels of analysis to assess their alignment. The approach could be helpful for studying other cases, particularly at times when a new field of policy is emerging.";http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1462901118300212;115-124;vol.86;Thomson Reuters ISI

Given such magnitude, it was expected to result in extreme warming and moisture anomalies in tropical areas. Here we characterize the spatial patterns of temperature anomalies and drought over tropical forests, including tropical South America (Amazonia), Africa and Asia/Indonesia during the 2015-2016 EN event. These spatial patterns of warming and drought are compared with those observed in previous strong EN events (1982-1983 and 1997-1998) and other moderate to strong EN events (e.g. 2004-2005 and 2009-2010). The link between the spatial patterns of drought and sea surface temperature anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific is also explored. We show that indeed the EN2015-2016 led to unprecedented warming compared to the other EN events over Amazonia, Africa and Indonesia, as a consequence of the background global warming trend. Anomalous accumulated extreme drought area over Amazonia was found during EN2015-2016, but this value may be closer to extreme drought area extents in the other two EN events in 1982-1983 and 1997-1998. Over Africa, datasets disagree, and it is difficult to conclude which EN event led to the highest accumulated extreme drought area. Our results show that the highest values of accumulated drought area over Africa were obtained in 2015-2016 and 1997-1998, with a long-term drying trend not observed over the other tropical regions. Over Indonesia, all datasets suggest that EN 1982-1983 and EN 1997-1998 (or even the drought of 2005) led to a higher extreme drought area than EN2015-2016. Uncertainties in precipitation datasets hinder consistent estimates of drought severity over tropical regions, and improved reanalysis products and station records are required.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Niño on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'. © 2018 The Author(s).;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0300;20170300;Vol.373 is.1760;Thomson Reuters ISI

A field measurement campaign at 63 households in the Temuco urban area was conducted in winter 2014 and is reported here. In this study, indoor and outdoor (24-hr) PM2.5 and its elemental composition were measured and compared. Infiltration parameters and outdoor/indoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 were also determined. A statistical evaluation of how various air quality interventions and household features influence indoor PM2.5 was also performed. This study determined median indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations of 44.4 and 41.8 μg/m3, respectively. An average infiltration factor (0.62 ± 0.06) was estimated using sulfur as a tracer species. Using a simple mass balance approach, median indoor and outdoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 concentrations were then estimated as 12.5 and 26.5 μg/m3, respectively; therefore, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from outdoor infiltration. This high percentage is due to high outdoor pollution and relatively high household air exchange rates (median: 1.06 h−1). This study found that S, Br and Rb were dominated by outdoor contributions, while Si, Ca, Ti, Fe and As originated from indoor sources. Using continuous indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements, a median indoor source strength of 75 μg PM2.5/min was estimated for the diurnal period, similar to literature results. For the evening period, the median estimate rose to 135 μg PM2.5/min, reflecting a more intense wood burning associated to cooking and space heating at night. Statistical test results (at the 90% confidence level) support the ongoing woodstove replacement program (reducing emissions) and household weatherization subsidies (reducing heating demand) for improving indoor air quality in southern Chile, and suggest that a cookstove improvement program might be helpful as well. In the city of Temuco, southern Chile, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from severe outdoor pollution due to intensive wood burning, enhanced by poor household building standards and fuel poverty.";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414372;477-487;vol.236;Thomson Reuters ISI

A receptor model (positive matrix factorization, version 5) analysis, applied to ambient PM10 chemical speciation from three short-term sampling campaigns, resolved four sources: crustal/road dust, sea salt, secondary sulfates, and emissions from Paipote copper smelter located 8 km east of Copiapó. Wind trajectories computed with US NOAA’s Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) supported the above source identification and explained variability in source contributions. It was found that crustal/road dust increased 50 μg/m3, in April 8-10, 2015, as compared with values in November 2014 and October-November 2015, respectively. This was the dominant PM10 source after the flooding and before debris were cleaned up, being on order of magnitude higher that the other source contributions. The Paipote copper smelter contributed with primary PM10 emissions and secondary sulfates; this combined contribution averaged 11.8 μg/m3. Sea salt contributions contributed an average of 3.3 μg/m3. In normal conditions, crustal/road dust averaged 2.9 μg/m3, but the other resolved sources also contributed with crustal elements as their emissions are transported by winds to Copiapó. The positive matrix factorization solution included an unresolved concentration of 7.4 μg/m3. The small number of samples and the lack of measurements of nitrate, ammonia, and organic and elemental carbon may explain this result. Hence, sources such as secondary nitrates and combustion sources plus fugitive dust from sources surrounding Copiapó might be included in that unresolved concentration.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11869-018-0549-5;341-351;vol.11 is.3;Thomson  Reuters ISI

The mid-Pliocene Warm Period experiment is part of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) – Phase 2, detailed in Haywood et al. (2016).

The goal of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) is to understand the response of the climate system to different climate forcings for documented climatic states very different from the present and historical climates. Through comparison with observations of the environmental impact of these climate changes, or with climate reconstructions based on physical, chemical, or biological records, PMIP also addresses the issue of how well state-of-the-art numerical models simulate climate change. Climate models are usually developed using the present and historical climates as references, but climate projections show that future climates will lie well outside these conditions. Palaeoclimates very different from these reference states therefore provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art models and a way to assess whether their sensitivity to forcings is compatible with palaeoclimatic evidence. Simulations of five different periods have been designed to address the objectives of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6): the millennium prior to the industrial epoch (CMIP6 name: past1000); the mid-Holocene, 6000 years ago (midHolocene); the Last Glacial Maximum, 21 000 years ago (lgm); the Last Interglacial, 127 000 years ago (lig127k); and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, 3.2 million years ago (midPliocene-eoi400). These climatic periods are well documented by palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records, with climate and environmental changes relevant for the study and projection of future climate changes. This paper describes the motivation for the choice of these periods and the design of the numerical experiments and database requests, with a focus on their novel features compared to the experiments performed in previous phases of PMIP and CMIP. It also outlines the analysis plan that takes advantage of the comparisons of the results across periods and across CMIP6 in collaboration with other MIPs.";https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/11/1033/2018/;1033-1057;vol.11 is.3;Thomson Reuters ISI

Nonetheless, there are many lowland regions – including the South American Pampa biome – with scarce tree ring data. We present the first two tree-ring chronologies for Scutia buxifolia in subtropical Southeastern South America (SESA), using 54 series from 29 trees in two sites in northern and southern Uruguay. We cross-dated annual rings and compared tree growth from 1950 to 2012 with regional climate variability, including rainfall, temperature and the Palmer Drought Severity Index – PDSI, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Overall, ring width variability was highly responsive to climate signals linked to water availability. For example, tree growth was positively correlated with accumulated rainfall in the summer-fall prior to ring formation for both chronologies. Summer climate conditions were key for tree growth, as shown by a negative effect of hot summer temperatures and a positive correlation with PDSI in late austral summer. The El Niño phase in late spring/early summer favored an increase in rainfall and annual tree growth, while the La Niña phase was associated with less rainfall and reduced tree growth. Extratropical climate factors such as SAM had an equally relevant effect on tree growth, whereby the positive phase of SAM had a negative effect over radial growth. These findings demonstrate the potential for dendroclimatic research and climate reconstruction in a region with scarce tree-ring data. They also improve the understanding of how climate variability may affect woody growth in native forests – an extremely limited ecosystem in the Pampa biome.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1125786518300249;113-122;Vol.52;Thomson Reuters ISI

";"Impact of residential combustion and transport emissions on air pollution in Santiago during winter
";"Atmospheric Environment
";;10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.06.043;1352-2310;"Santiago (33.5°S, 70.5°W), the capital of Chile, is frequently affected by extreme air pollution events during wintertime deteriorating air quality (AQ) and thus affecting the health of its population. Intense residential heating and on-road transport emissions combined with poor circulation and vertical mixing are the main factors responsible for these events. A modelling system composed of a chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) and a meteorological model (WRF) was implemented to assess the AQ impacts of residential and transportation sources in the Santiago basin. A two-week period of July 2015 with various days with poor AQ was simulated focusing on the impact on AQ with respect to fully inhalable particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Three emission scenarios, within the range of targeted reductions of the decontamination plan of Santiago, were tested; namely 50% reduction of residential emission, 50% reduction of transport emissions and the combination of both. An additional scenario decreasing transport emissions in 10% was carried out to examine whether a linear dependence of surface concentrations on changes in emissions exists.

The system was validated against surface and vertically resolved meteorological measurements. The model reproduces the daily surface concentration variability from the AQ monitoring network of Santiago. However, the model not fully captures the emissions variations inferred from the observations which may be due to missing sources such as resuspension of dust.

Results show that, during the period studied, although both residential and transportation sources contribute to observed AQ levels in Santiago, reducing transport emissions is more effective in terms of reducing the number of days with pollution events than decreasing residential combustion. This difference in impact is largely due to the spatial distribution of the emission sources. While most of the residential combustion is emitted in the outskirts of the city, most of the transport emissions occur within the city, where most of the stations from AQ monitoring network of Santiago are located. As can be expected, the largest improvement of AQ in Santiago is achieved by the combined reduction of emissions in both sectors. Sensitivity analysis with 10% reduction in transport emissions reveals a linear behavior between emissions and concentrations for NOX and approximate linear behavior for PM2.5. The absence of secondary aerosols formation and dust resuspension in the current simulation could explain this deviation from linearity for fine particles. Nevertheless, it suggests that the results can be used for mitigation policies with emissions reductions below the 50% used in this study.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1352231018304345;195-208;vol.190;Thomson Reuters ISI

Despite this high fire activity, the controls and drivers and the spatiotemporal pattern of fires are not well understood. To identify the large-scale trends and drivers of recent fire activity across six regions in south-central Chile (~32–40 S Latitude) we evaluated MODIS satellite-derived fire detections and compared this data with Chilean Forest Service records for the period 2001–2017. MODIS burned area estimates provide a spatially and temporally comprehensive record of fire activity across an important bioclimatic transition zone between dry Mediterranean shrublands/ sclerophyllous forests and wetter deciduous-broadleaf evergreen forests. Results suggest fire activity was highly variable in any given year, with no statistically significant trend in the number of fires or mean annual area burned. Evaluation of the variables associated with spatiotemporal patterns of fire for the 2001–2017 period indicate vegetation type, biophysical conditions (e.g., elevation, slope), mean annual and seasonal climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation) and mean population density have the greatest influence on the probability of fire occurrence and burned area for any given year. Both the number of fires and annual area burned were greatest in warmer, biomass-rich lowland Bío-Bío and Araucanía regions. Resource selection analyses indicate fire ‘preferentially’ occurs in exotic plantation forests, mixed native-exotic forests, native sclerophyll forests, pasture lands and matorral, vegetation types that all provide abundant, flammable and connected biomass for burning. Structurally and compositionally homogenous exotic plantation forests may promote fire spread greater than native deciduous-Nothofagaceae forests which were once widespread in the southern parts of the study area. In the future, the coincidence of warmer and drier conditions in landscapes dominated by flammable and fuel-rich forest plantations and mixed native-exotic and sclerophyll forests are likely to further promote large fires in south-central Chile. © 2018 McWethy et al.

In Chile, the forest monitoring system was initiated in 1994, which has been continued through the implementation of regional updates. This has enabled a temporal monitoring of the distribution and surface covered by native forest. However, while regional updates have reported increase in the surface covered by native forest, other studies have shown an opposite trend. Therefore, the capacity of the forest monitoring system to measure the temporal variation in forest areas was evaluated. Specifically, a review of reports and official data of the national forest monitoring system was carried out through the fulfillment of three basic criteria: i) comparability, ii) replicability and iii) quality. According to our results, the Chilean forest monitoring system does not fulfill their basic requirements because: (i) methodologies have not been consistent over time; (ii) it does not provide a baseline of land cover or forest loss that allows comparisons with changing forest area; iii) there is not adequate error estimation and how it can affect the results and analysis  of monitoring.

";"The Energy Center has developed a co-construction methodology to address the challenges of technology transfer-based on distributed generation projects- in the context of energy transitions in isolated locations. Based on the experiences developed between 2010 and 2017, this paper analyses the process of preparing the Co-construction methodology. New tools were identified under the light of a theoretical-methodological reflection and a new version of co-construction methodology is proposed from this discussion. This learning process combines academic research and applied projects. It has provided Energy Center with an improved set of tools for current projects, and also contributed to a theoretical-methodological discussion based on new research activities. The main problems of method faced are presented during interdisciplinary work, such as: common understanding of fundamental concepts (sustainability, participation, community); the domination of one discipline over the others; the different visions of the priorities within the same project. And those problems given by the participation process under the paradox of “framing-overflowing”, where the constraints of actual projects (deadlines, budget, and specific KPIs) could limit the possibility of performing in depth diagnostics and building trust.

Here we present a first attempt using a paired-basin approach to study the evolution of fire regimes in sectors dominated by humid Nothofagus forests and the xeric Patagonian steppe in the Magallanes region of Chilean Patagonia (51°S). We analyzed sediment cores from two small lakes and a bog located within the same climate zone on opposite sides of the forest-steppe ecotone, ~28 km apart. The position of this biological boundary east of the Andes is controlled by the strength and position of the southern westerly winds, which constitute the sole source of precipitation throughout western Patagonia. Our results indicate that fires have occurred in the study region repeated times over the last ~13,000 years at bi- and tridecadal timescales. Sectors currently dominated by Patagonian steppe feature high frequency and low magnitude of local fires, and vice versa in humid forests. Climate-driven expansion of Nothofagus scrubland/woodland into steppe environments over the last ~4,200 years increased the magnitude and lowered the frequency of fire events, culminating with peak Nothofagus abundance, fire magnitude and frequency during the last millennium. We also detect divergences between lake-based vs. bog-based paleofire histories among paired sites located within the Patagonian steppe, ~12 km apart, which we attribute to local burning of the bog at times of lowered water table. This divergence suggests to us that bog-based vegetation and fire histories exacerbate a local, azonal, signal blurring extra-local or regional regimes, thus accounting for some discrepancies in the Quaternary paleovegetation/paleoclimate literature of southern Patagonia.;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2018.00034/full;;vol.6;Scopus

";The Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) are the surface expression of geostrophic winds that encircle the southern mid-latitudes. In conjunction with the Southern Ocean, they establish a coupled system that not only controls climate in the southern third of the world, but is also closely connected to the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and CO2 degassing from the deep ocean. Paradoxically, little is known about their behavior since the last ice age and relationships with mid-latitude glacier history and tropical climate variability. Here we present a lake sediment record from Chilean Patagonia (51°S) that reveals fluctuations of the low-level SWW at mid-latitudes, including strong westerlies during the Antarctic Cold Reversal, anomalously low intensity during the early Holocene, which was unfavorable for glacier growth, and strong SWW since ∼7.5 ka. We detect nine positive Southern Annular Mode-like events at centennial timescale since ∼5.8 ka that alternate with cold/wet intervals favorable for glacier expansions (Neoglaciations) in southern Patagonia. The correspondence of key features of mid-latitude atmospheric circulation with shifts in tropical climate since ∼10 ka suggests that coherent climatic shifts in these regions have driven climate change in vast sectors of the Southern Hemisphere at centennial and millennial timescales.;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21836-6;;vol.8 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios.

";"We present the evolution of the atmospheric variables that affect planetary climate by increasing the obliquity by using a general circulation model (PlaSim) coupled to a slab ocean with mixed layer flux correction.

We increase the obliquity between 30° and 90° in 16 aquaplanets with liquid sea surface and perform the simulation allowing the sea ice cover formation to be a consequence of its atmospheric dynamics.

Insolation is maintained constant in each experiment, but changing the obliquity affects the radiation budget and the large scale circulation. Earth-like atmospheric dynamics is observed for planets with obliquity under 54°. Above this value, the latitudinal temperature gradient is reversed giving place to a new regime of jet streams, affecting the shape of Hadley and Ferrel cells and changing the position of the InterTropical Convergence Zone.

As humidity and high temperatures determine Earth’s habitability, we introduce the wet bulb temperature as an atmospheric index of habitability for Earth-like aquaplanets with above freezing temperatures. The aquaplanets are habitable all year round at all latitudes for values under 54°; above this value habitability decreases toward the poles due to high temperatures.";http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103517305407;84-90;vol.305;Thomson Reuters ISI

São Paulo, Brazil has experienced severe water shortages and record low levels of its water reservoirs in 2013–2014. We evaluate the contributions of Amazon deforestation and climate change to low precipitation levels using a modelling approach, and address whether similar precipitation anomalies might occur more frequently in a warming world. Precipitation records from INMET show that the dry anomaly extended over a fairly large region to the north of São Paulo. Unique features of this event were anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the Southern Atlantic, an extension of the sub tropical high into the São Paulo region and moisture flux divergence over São Paulo. The SST anomalies were very similar in 2013/14 and 2014/15, suggesting they played a major role in forcing the dry conditions. The SST anomalies consisted of three zonal bands: a cold band in the tropics, a warm band to the south of São Paulo and another cold band poleward of 40 S. We performed ensemble climate simulations with observed SSTs prescribed, vegetation cover either fixed at 1870 levels or varying over time, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) either fixed at pre-industrial levels (280 ppm CO2) or varying over time. These simulations exhibit similar precipitation deficits over the São Paulo region in 2013/14. From this, we infer that SST patterns and the associated large-scale state of the atmosphere were important factors in determining the precipitation anomalies, while deforestation and increased GHGs only weakly modulated the signal. Finally, analyses of future climate simulations from CMIP5 models indicate that the frequency of such precipitation anomalies is not likely to change in a warmer climate. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Here we show that these landscapes were shallow freshwater lakes and wetlands during the last glacial period, periodically between ~46.9 ka and 7.7 ka. The moisture appears to have been sourced from increased Andean runoff and most of our chronologies for these deposits were coeval with the Central Andean Pluvial Event (17.5-14.2 ka and 13.8-9.7 ka), but we also find evidence for older as well as slightly younger wet phases. These environments supported a diverse hygrophyte vegetation, as well as an array of diatoms, ostracods and gastropods. Using a regional hydrological model, we estimate that recharge rates from 1.5 to 4 times present were required to activate and maintain these wetlands in the past. Activation in the late Pleistocene was part of a regional enhancement of water resources, extending from the Andes, downstream and through riparian corridors, to the lowest and most arid portions of the desert itself. This fundamentally unique environment was encountered by the earliest human explorers in the region, and most likely facilitated migration and encampments on a landscape that at present lacks macroscopic life on its surface.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277379117310521;224-245;Vol.197;Thomson Reuters ISI

During a recent research cruise in Baker Fjord, Chile (47°54'S-74°30'W), a megaturbidite was described between the Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields. Here, we aim to determine the depositional processes of the megaturbidite and identify its origin. Based on the turbidite's location, a possible origin was the early Holocene drainage of paleo-lake General Carrera, which was recently proposed in the literature as having produced a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) that drained through Baker Fjord. Due to the fjord's location in a subduction zone, and close to the Chile Triple Junction, however, seismic activity must also be considered as a potential triggering mechanism. To achieve our goals, we undertook a multi-proxy analysis of sediment core MD07-3121, including sedimentology (grain size, loss-on-ignition, foraminifera counts), magnetic properties, bulk organic geochemistry, and radiocarbon dating, and we analysed bathymetric maps and sub-bottom profiles. Our grain-size results display a diagnostic fining upward trend and show evidence of seiching in the 733-cm-thick megaturbidite. The age of the event (5513-5211 cal yr BP) contradicts the hypothesis of an early Holocene GLOF origin. Bulk organic geochemical results indicate that the sediments that compose the turbidite are clearly of marine origin, which further goes against a GLOF origin. In addition, the megaturbidite is underlain by a 1136 cm thick mass transport deposit (MTD), also composed of marine sediments. According to the sub-bottom profiles, the MTD and the megaturbidite originate from the reworking of thick packages of sediment previously deposited on nearby sills and on the fjord's flanks. Furthermore, similar coeval deposits are found in an adjacent sub-basin. We therefore interpret these deposits to be triggered by an earthquake during the late mid-Holocene. While megathrust and intraslab earthquakes are possible in the region, we argue that a crustal earthquake is the most likely seismic trigger in the study area. This study reveals the first earthquake-triggered megaturbidite south of the Chile Triple Junction.;http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0037073818300113;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

Subalpine woodlands of Austrocedrus chilensis include long-lived trees resilient to low-intensity fires, which can provide valuable tree-ring-based information about fire history. In this work, we performed an annually resolved multicentury reconstruction of past fires from fire-scar records identified in relict Austrocedrus wood found on steep highly-eroded and rocky slopes with coarser fuel structure in the upper Cachapoal Valley, central Andes of Chile. We compared this fire record with historical land-use changes and extensive reconstructions of regional precipitation and temperature, as well as large-scale climatic patterns. The highest fire frequencies were recorded in the Spanish settlement period (1541–1750), when land-clearing activities, cattle ranching, agriculture, and mining practices became widespread after the Spanish conquest. At an interannual time scale, fire occurrence and precipitation were unconnected during the Spanish settlement. By contrast, in the indigenous period (1200–1540), under the influence of the aboriginal Chiquillanes people, fires occurred in wet years with high vegetation productivity. In the livestock grazing period (1751–1950), when large cattle ranches were established, fires occurred in dry years after a wet year. Fires in this period were likely ignited under conditions of high fuel flammability to improve plant production and promote intensive livestock grazing. At a multidecadal time scale, fires were more frequent in cold periods throughout the whole record. These findings suggest that herbaceous fuel accumulation and flammability, modulated by climate variation and human land uses, were the main factors promoting fires spread in this Mediterranean subalpine area. Our research emphasizes the importance of relict Austrocedrus wood for fire history reconstruction and expands knowledge about fire regime shifts over the past eight centuries in southern South America.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921818117304988;137-147;vol.167;Thomson Reuters ISI

In particular, increasing inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may affect gas dynamics and alter seasonal changes in gas production. Here, we analysed variations in CH4 and CO2 dynamics in sub-basins of an acidic bog lake, which was artificially divided into four quarters three decades ago, leading to divergence in water chemistry and biology. In the divided lake, only the south-west basin (SW) received DOC inputs from an adjacent peat bog, while the north-east basin (NE) was hydrologically disconnected. A year-long determination of CH4 and CO2 production and emission patterns in the two contrasting basins exposed the indirect mechanisms by which DOC supply exercised control on greenhouse gas dynamics in this shallow lake. In both basins, dissolved CH4 was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (O2) through the water column, suggesting that aerobic methanotrophy is an important regulator of CH4 emissions in this lake. In contrast, the amount of CO2 stored in oxic and anoxic layers was not significantly different between the basins, suggesting that O2 is not the most important driver of dissolved CO2. Estimated total CH4 and CO2 emissions were 2.1 and 1.7 times lower in the NE basin than in the SW basin, with major CH4 and CO2 emissions occurring during the fall turnover. The differences in CH4 and CO2 emissions suggest that the hydro-physical properties, namely seasonal temperature, the duration of stratification and O2 availability, are the main drivers of CH4 and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from small shallow lakes under the influence of DOC inputs under global warming pressure.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/fwb.13182;;;Thomson  Reuters ISI

";Mineral dust aerosols cool Earth directly by scattering incoming solar radiation and indirectly by affecting clouds and biogeochemical cycles. Recent Earth history has featured quasi-100,000-y, glacial−interglacial climate cycles with lower/higher temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations during glacials/interglacials. Global average, glacial maxima dust levels were more than 3 times higher than during interglacials, thereby contributing to glacial cooling. However, the timing, strength, and overall role of dust−climate feedbacks over these cycles remain unclear. Here we use dust deposition data and temperature reconstructions from ice sheet, ocean sediment, and land archives to construct dust−climate relationships. Although absolute dust deposition rates vary greatly among these archives, they all exhibit striking, nonlinear increases toward coldest glacial conditions. From these relationships and reconstructed temperature time series, we diagnose glacial−interglacial time series of dust radiative forcing and iron fertilization of ocean biota, and use these time series to force Earth system model simulations. The results of these simulations show that dust−climate feedbacks, perhaps set off by orbital forcing, push the system in and out of extreme cold conditions such as glacial maxima. Without these dust effects, glacial temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations would have been much more stable at higher, intermediate glacial levels. The structure of residual anomalies over the glacial−interglacial climate cycles after subtraction of dust effects provides constraints for the strength and timing of other processes governing these cycles.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708174115;2026-2031;vol.115 is.9;Thomson Reuters ISI

Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564 nm and 0.009 at the 408 nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15 km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017JD027309;1113-1131;vol.123 is.2;Thomson Reuters ISI

Four high-resolution vertical profiles for gases (N2O and CH4) and nutrients (NO3- and PO43-) were measured using a Pumped Profiling System (PPS), connected with a liquid degassing membrane coupled with Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) and a nutrient auto-analyzer, respectively. The membrane-CRDS system maintains a linear response over a wide range of gas concentrations, detecting N2O and CH4 levels as low as 0.0774±0.0004 and 0.1011±0.001 ppm, respectively.
    Continuous profiles for gases and nutrients were similar to those reported throughout the ESP, with pronounced N2O and CH4 peaks at the upper oxycline and at the base of the euphotic zone and pycnocline, respectively, in the coastal zone; but almost constant depth profiles in the subtropical gyre. Additionally, other vertical gas and nutrient structures were observed using continuous sampling, which would not have been detected by discrete sampling.

The Chilean water market, one of the main examples of the application of neoliberal policies in water management, has received mixed appraisals although, at present, few empirical studies evaluate the social and environmental conditions associated with their operation. This paper, on the contrary, maintains the necessity to assess the capacity of market-based models to face situations of water stress, particularly since mega-drought phenomena are projected to become a recurring and increasing problem during the following decades because of climate change. The study offers a mixed bottom-up and top-down qualitative empirical analysis of how the Chilean water market operates, providing relevant insights into four dimensions of the social–ecological resilience of the watershed: redundancy, diversity and flexibility; connectivity, collaboration and collective action; social–ecological memory and learning; self-organization and governance of system changes. The conclusion is that water scarcity is self-produced: despite the flexibility provided by market-based water management, the combined effect of strong deregulation, of the absence of territorial planning and integrated management of water resources, and of short-term attitudes and generalized mistrust, has led the system to the critical situation it is now facing.";http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10668-018-0271-3;;;Thomson Reuters ISI

";"Drier climatic conditions will be the future scenario in many regions worldwide, including southern South America. Few studies have characterized the ecophysiological vulnerability of the endemic tree species that inhabit this area, to climate change. In this study we assessed the hydraulic vulnerability of the longest-lived tree of the Southern Hemisphere, Fitzroya cupressoides, focusing on adult trees and saplings from two highly disturbed populations: the Coastal Range (AC) and Central Depression (FN) of southern Chile, which represent contrasting site conditions. This, as a basis for the design of conservation strategies to safeguard the persistence of these endangered forests in a drier future. We assessed water potentials (WP) throughout a growing season, their relationships with environmental conditions, as well as leaf and stem (branch) traits and hydraulic safety margins. Despite that the studied summer was the second driest in the last seven decades, minimum WP were not that negative (−1.3 to −1.5 MPa); which could be partly explained by a high leaf capacitance in this species. Adult trees and saplings from both sites did not significantly differ in their WP at turgor loss point, and their associated leaf safety margins, which were relatively low in all cases. However, they significantly differed in the xylem WP causing a 50% loss of stem conductivity (P50): adults AC: −5.14, saplings AC: −2.53, adults FN: −3.71, and saplings FN: −3.87 MPa. These values led to a relatively large stem safety margin (SSM) in most cases, and their variation was not explained neither by wood density, nor by tracheid size changes. Moreover, there appears to be an ontogenic adjustment in the more restrictive site AC, which was not seen in FN. Within the continuum of species strategies to cope with water stress, Fitzroya has features of the two ends of the continuum: tissues with large SSM, and tissues that sustain milder operation pressures through capacitance. Although Fitzroya appears to be relatively resistant to water scarcity, saplings from AC, seem to be the most vulnerable to the aridification trend in southern Chile. Moreover, future drying could become a significant extra threat to the highly endangered Central Depression population. Conservation actions are urgently needed to secure the future of Fitzroya forests in southern Chile.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037811271830793X;472-484;vol.430;Thomson Reuters ISI

In the northernmost region of Chile, the most frequent archaeological indicators of these caravan systems are trails and rock art images. Cruces de Molinos (LL-43), a rock art site in the Lluta valley, 1100 masl, 40 km from the Pacific littoral, expands the ceremonial role of rock art sites, materialized, not only as regards the iconography portrayed and alluding to these practices, but also in terms of articulated carcass remains and detached anatomical units of camelids, intentionally deposited in a cache beneath one of the engraved blocks. This paper analyzes the site considering the visual imagery, spatial location, archaeological deposits and features associated with rock art. Based on the predominance of camelid and caravan motifs in rock art images, the extraordinary setting and location of the site on the valley's upper slopes, which is far removed from local settlements, but closely connected with a llama caravan trade network linking the chaupiyunga ecozone with the highlands (sierra and Altiplano ecozones), we suggest that Cruces de Molinos was not a rest stop for caravanners, but a ceremonial place, and not for local farmers, but for highland herders.

Part II: Horizontal and Vertical Structures Observed by a Scanning Doppler Radar;Monthly Weather Review;;10.1175/MWR-D-17-0227.1;0027-0644;This study documents the mean properties and variability of kinematic and precipitation structures associated with orographic precipitation along the coast of Northern California in the context of terrain-trapped airflows (TTAs). TTAs are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. Seven land-falling winter storms are examined with observations from a scanning X-band Doppler radar deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California. Additional information is provided by a 915-MHz wind-profiling radar, surface meteorology, a GPS receiver, and balloon soundings. The composite kinematic structure during TTA conditions exhibits a significant horizontal gradient of wind direction from the coast to approximately 50 km offshore and a low-level jet (LLJ) that surmounts a weaker airflow offshore corresponding to the TTA, with a zone of enhanced precipitation evident between ~5 and 25 km offshore and oriented nearly parallel to the coastline. Conversely, the composite kinematic structure during NO-TTA conditions exhibits a smaller offshore horizontal gradient of wind direction and precipitation structures are generally enhanced within ~15 km of the coastline. Interstorm variability analysis reveals significant variations in kinematic structures during both TTA and NO-TTA conditions, whereas significant variations in precipitation structures are only evident during TTA conditions. The interstorm analysis also illustrates more clearly how LLJ vertical structures evident during NO-TTA conditions exhibit ascent along the coast and over the coastal mountains, which is in contrast to TTA conditions where the ascent occurs offshore and over the TTA.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/MWR-D-17-0227.1;2381-2402;vol.146 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

In this study we use data collected during an intensive oceanographic cruise along the Magellan Strait into the Almirantazgo Fjord in southern Patagonia to evaluate how different sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and recycling may impact particulate organic carbon (POC) δ13C and influence the nutrients and carbonate system spatial distribution. The carbonate system presented large spatial heterogeneity. The lowest total alkalinity and DIC were associated to freshwater dilution observed near melting glaciers. The δ13CDIC analysis suggests that most DIC in the upper 50 m depth was not derived from terrestrial organic matter remineralization. 13C-depleted riverine and ice-melting DIC influence the DIC pool along the study area, but due to that DIC concentration from rivers and glaciers is relatively low, atmospheric carbon contribution or biological processes seem to be more relevant. Intense undersaturation of CO2 was observed in high chlorophyll waters. Respired DIC coming from the bottom waters seems to be almost insignificant for the inorganic carbon pool and therefore do not impact significantly the stable carbon isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon and POC in the upper 50 m depth. Considering the combined effect of cold and low alkalinity waters due to ice melting, our results highlight the importance of these processes in determining corrosive waters for CaCO3 and local acidification processes associated to calving glacier in fjord ecosystems.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017JG003907;256-270;Vol.123 is.1;Thomson Reuters ISI

An AR detection algorithm was developed based on integrated water vapor transport (IVT) from 6-hourly CFSR reanalysis data over a 16-yr period (2001-16). AR landfalls were linked to precipitation using a comprehensive observing network that spanned large variations in terrain along and across the Andes from 27° to 55°S, including some sites with hourly data. Along the Pacific (west) coast, AR landfalls are most frequent between 38° and 50°S, averaging 35-40 days yr-1. This decreases rapidly to the south and north of this maximum, as well as to the east of the Andes. Landfalling ARs are more frequent in winter/spring (summer/fall) to the north (south) of ~43°S. ARs contribute 45%-60% of the annual precipitation in subtropical Chile (37°-32°S) and 40%-55% along the midlatitude west coast (37°-47°S). These values significantly exceed those in western North America, likely due to the Andes being taller. In subtropical and midlatitude regions, roughly half of all events with top-quartile precipitation rates occur under AR conditions. Median daily and hourly precipitation in ARs is 2-3 times that of other storms. The results of this study extend knowledge of the key roles of ARs on precipitation, weather, and climate in the South American region. They enable comparisons with other areas globally, provide context for specific events, and support local nowcasting and forecasting. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0006.1;1671-1687;Vol.19 is.10;Thomson Reuters ISI

Our ability as a scientific community to evaluate changes in the water-column inventories of methane and nitrous oxide depends largely on our capacity to obtain robust and accurate concentration measurements that can be validated across different laboratory groups. This study represents the first formal international intercomparison of oceanic methane and nitrous oxide measurements whereby participating laboratories received batches of seawater samples from the subtropical Pacific Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Additionally, compressed gas standards from the same calibration scale were distributed to the majority of participating laboratories to improve the analytical accuracy of the gas measurements. The computations used by each laboratory to derive the dissolved gas concentrations were also evaluated for inconsistencies (e.g., pressure and temperature corrections, solubility constants). The results from the intercomparison and intercalibration provided invaluable insights into methane and nitrous oxide measurements. It was observed that analyses of seawater samples with the lowest concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide had the lowest precisions. In comparison, while the analytical precision for samples with the highest concentrations of trace gases was better, the variability between the different laboratories was higher: 36% for methane and 27% for nitrous oxide. In addition, the comparison of different batches of seawater samples with methane and nitrous oxide concentrations that ranged over an order of magnitude revealed the ramifications of different calibration procedures for each trace gas. Finally, this study builds upon the intercomparison results to develop recommendations for improving oceanic methane and nitrous oxide measurements, with the aim of precluding future analytical discrepancies between laboratories.;https://www.biogeosciences.net/15/5891/2018/;5891-5907;Vol.15 is.19;Thomson Reuters ISI

";"Seasonal drought effects on the water quality of the Biobío River, Central Chile
";Environmental Science and Pollution Research;;10.1007/s11356-018-1415-6;0944-1344;Quantifying the effect of droughts on ecosystem functions is essential to the development of coastal zone and river management under a changing climate. It is widely acknowledged that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts, which can affect important ecosystem services, such as the regional supply of clean water. Very little is understood about how droughts affect the water quality of Chilean high flow rivers. This paper intends to investigate the effect of an, recently identified, unprecedented drought in Chile (2010–2015), on the Biobío River water quality, (36°45′–38°49′ S and 71°00′–73°20′ W), Central Chile. This river is one of the largest Chilean rivers and it provides abundant freshwater. Water quality (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chloride, sodium, nutrients, and trace metals), during the drought (2010–2015), was compared with a pre-drought period (2000–2009) over two reaches (upstream and downstream) of the river. Multivariate analysis and seasonal Mann-Kendall trend analyses and a Theil-Sen estimator were employed to analyze trends and slopes of the reaches. Results indicated a significant decreased trend in total suspended solids and a slightly increasing trend in water temperature and EC, major ions, and trace metals (chrome, lead, iron, and cobalt), mainly in summer and autumn during the drought. The reduced variability upstream suggested that nutrient and metal concentrations were more constant than downstream. The results evidenced, due to the close relationship between river discharge and water quality, a slightly decline of the water quality downstream of the Biobío River during drought period, which could be attenuated in a post-drought period. These results displayed that water quality is vulnerable to reductions in flow, through historical and emerging solutes/contaminants and induced pH mobilization. Consequently, seasonal changes and a progressive reduction of river flow affect the ecosystem functionality in this key Chilean river. The outcomes from this research can be used to improve how low flow conditions and the effects of a reduction in the river volume and discharge are assessed, which is the case under the scenario of more frequent drought periods.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11356-018-1415-6;13844-13856;Vol.25 is,14;Thomson Reuters ISI

Five major rivers (Maipo, Mataquito, Maule, Itata and Biobío) drain into this region with annual mean discharge ranging from 120 to 1000 m3 s-1. River discharge and coastal plume area present a marked seasonal cycle, reaching maximum values during the winter rainy season (June-September). Export of riverine nutrients also peaks in winter, leading to an increase in phytoplankton biomass within the plumes that can be twice larger than the background values in coastal areas away from the river mouths. Wintertime river discharge, plume area and nutrient export are also correlated at interannual time scales. During a recent extended dry period (2010-2014), river discharges, plume areas and nutrient export clearly decreased by about 50% compared to historical values, reducing significantly the size of the chlorophyll pool within plumes off Central Chile during winter. The potential impacts of droughts are discussed in terms of coastal ecology and primary production, a highly relevant issue considering the projections of a dry climate over Central Chile in the future. Systematic evidence of mega-drought effects upon coastal productivity still does not exist, but it remains a priority to further investigate and quantify these impacts.;;;impress;Scopus

Para ello, se presenta una revisión bibliográfica que discute distintas epistemologías, teorías y definiciones de la participación, con énfasis en las dificultades para su implementación en el contexto chileno. Posteriormente, se revisan los mecanismos de participación ciudadana desplegados en el desarrollo de instrumentos de gobernanza del cambio climático existentes en Chile. Se distinguen tipos de participación utilizados y se identifican experiencias conducidas desde la sociedad civil y la academia. Finalmente, se discuten los alcances y las limitaciones de los modelos de participación implementados y se resalta la importancia de incrementar la influencia de la sociedad civil y de mejorar los mecanismos existentes. Esto se explica por un escenario de cambio climático que posiblemente requerirá una mayor cantidad de actores involucrados en la toma de decisiones, para anticipar posibles divisiones frente al desarrollo de acciones de adaptación o mitigación más radicales, y que al mismo tiempo demandará mayores niveles de responsabilidad, compromiso y acción de la ciudadanía.;http://revistas.javeriana.edu.co/index.php/ambienteydesarrollo/article/view/22189;43-60;Vol.21 is.41;Thomson  Reuters ESCI

E., Gómez-González, S., Lara, A., Garreaud, R., Díaz-Hormazabal, I.;The 2010-2015 Megadrought and its influence on the fire regime in central and south-central Chile;Ecosphere;;10.1002/ecs2.2300;2150-8925;Forest ﬁre activity has increased in recent years in central and south-central Chile. Drought conditions have been associated with the increase of large wildﬁres, area burned and longer ﬁre seasons. This study examines the inﬂuence of drought on ﬁre regimes and discusses landscape management opportunities to decrease ﬁre hazard. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the effect of the 2010–2015 Megadrought (MD) compared to 1990–2009 period on ﬁre activity (ﬁre-season length, number of ﬁres and burned area across months, ﬁre sizes, regions and vegetation cover types, simultaneity, and duration of ﬁres) in central and south-central Chile (32°–39° S), using contemporary ﬁre statistics derived from the Chilean Forest Service. For large ﬁre events (>200 ha) the average season length increased by 67 d (44%), comparing 2010–2015 to 1990–2009. Earlier and later ignition dates resulted in extended ﬁre seasons in MD years. During the MD, the number, area burned, simultaneity, and duration of large ﬁres increased signiﬁcantly compared to the control period, including the unprecedented occurrence of large ﬁres during winter. The burned area in large ﬁres increased in all vegetation types, during the MD compared to the control period, especially in the exotic plantation cover type. The regions that were most affected by ﬁre (i.e., total area burned) during the MD wereMaule, B ıo-B ıo, and Araucan ıa (35–39° S) that concentrate >75% of forest plantations in Chile. Although both maximum temperatures and precipitation are drivers of ﬁre activity, a simple attribution analysis indicates that the sustained rainfall deﬁcit during 2010–2015 was the most critical factor in the enhanced ﬁre activity. Future climate change predictions indicate more recurrent, intense, and temporally extended droughts for central and south-central Chile. Under this scenario, land-use planning and ﬁre and forest management strategies must promote a more diverse and less ﬂammable landscape mosaic limiting high load, homogenous, and continuous exotic plantations.;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ecs2.2300;e02300;Vol.9 is.8;Thomson Reuters ISI

Identifying the major ecological drivers regulating fire activity across space and time is critical to formulating sustainable policies of landscape planning and management under global change scenarios. However, large scale studies quantifying the relative importance of relevant fire drivers across different time periods are largely lacking. We conducted a high-resolution spatial survey in Central Chile and used structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climate, human impact, land uses, and topography on the number of fires and burned area across two distinct periods of time (2000–2005 and 2011–2016). Mean temperature and agricultural use had the highest direct positive effect on the number of fires and burned area in the two studied periods, and thus were the major ecological predictors of fire activity. Human impact was also an important predictor of fire attributes. Topography had multiple indirect effects on fire activity by regulating land use, temperature, and human impact, but direct effects were negligible. Precipitation seasonality, drought and aridity indexes, native forests, and plantations, were less relevant predictors of fire activity. Even so, our SEMs suggested that areas dominated by native forests tended to have lower number of fires than those covered by croplands or plantations. Our results suggest that fire activity in Central Chile will be highly sensitive to increases in human pressure, land use change and warming by climate change. Because the relative importance of the predictors of fire activity was steady over time, the knowledge derived from this study provides critical insights for preventive fire management and landscape planning. The control of stubble burning, native forest restoration and sustainable forestry management could improve social adaptation to a fire-prone future.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112718315962;535-543;Vol.433;Thomson  Reuters ISI

We contextualize these fires in terms of estimates of global fire intensity using MODIS satellite record, and provide an overview of the climatic factors and recent changes in land use that led to the active fire season and estimate the impact of fire emissions to human health. The primary fire activity in late January coincided with extreme fire weather conditions including all-time (1979–2017) daily records for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and maximum temperature, producing some of the most energetically intense fire events on Earth in the last 15-years. Fire activity was further enabled by a warm moist growing season in 2016 that interrupted an intense drought that started in 2010. The land cover in this region had been extensively modified, with less than 20% of the original native vegetation remaining, and extensive plantations of highly flammable exotic Pinus and Eucalyptus species established since the 1970s. These plantations were disproportionally burnt (44% of the burned area) in 2017, and associated with the highest fire severities, as part of an increasing trend of fire extent in plantations over the past three decades. Smoke from the fires exposed over 9.5 million people to increased concentrations of particulate air pollution, causing an estimated 76 premature deaths and 209 additional admissions to hospital for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. This study highlights that Mediterranean biogeographic regions with expansive Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations and associated rural depopulation are vulnerable to intense wildfires with wide ranging social, economic, and environmental impacts, which are likely to become more frequent due to longer and more extreme wildfire seasons.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-018-1084-1;;;Thomson  Reuters ISI

Consequently, WRF has problems forecasting rainfall events over Chilean mountainous terrain and foothills, where some of the main cities are located, and where intense rainfall occurs due to cutoff lows. This work analyzes an ensemble of microphysics schemes to enhance initial forecasts made by the Chilean Weather Agency in the front range of Santiago. We first tested different vertical levels resolution, land use and land surface models, as well as meteorological forcing (GFS/FNL). The final ensemble configuration considered three microphysics schemes and lead times over three rainfall events between 2015 and 2017. Cutoff low complex meteorological characteristics impede the temporal simulation of rainfall properties. With three days of lead time, WRF properly forecasts the rainiest N-hours and temperatures during the event, although more accuracy is obtained when the rainfall is caused by a meteorological frontal system. Finally, the WSM6 microphysics option had the best performance, although further analysis using other storms and locations in the area are needed to strengthen this result.;http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/9/8/304;304;Vol.9 is.8;Thomson  Reuters ISI

However, one of the main constraints is that meteorological stations are riddled with missing climatic data. This study compared five approaches for estimating monthly precipitation records: inverse distance weighting (IDW), a modification of IDW that includes elevation differences between target and neighboring stations (IDWm), correlation coefficient weighting (CCW), multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Methods: A complete series of monthly precipitation records (1995–2012) from twenty meteorological stations located in central Chile were used. Two target stations were selected and their neighboring stations, located within a radius of 25 km (3 stations) and 50 km (9 stations), were identified. Cross-validation was used for evaluating the accuracy of the estimation approaches. The performance and predictive capability of the approaches were evaluated using the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), the percent bias (PBIAS), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). For testing the main and interactive effects of the radius of influence and estimation approaches, a two-level factorial design considering the target station as the blocking factor was used. Results: ANN and MLR showed the best statistics for all the stations and radius of influence. However, these approaches were not significantly different with IDWm. Inclusion of elevation differences into IDW significantly improved IDWm estimates. In terms of precision, similar estimates were obtained when applying ANN, MLR or IDWm, and the radius of influence had a significant influence on their estimates, we conclude that estimates based on nine neighboring stations located within a radius of 50 km are needed for completing missing monthly precipitation data in regions with complex topography. Conclusions: It is concluded that approaches based on ANN, MLR and IDWm had the best performance in two sectors located in south-central Chile with a complex topography. A radius of influence of 50 km (9 neighboring stations) is recommended for completing monthly precipitation data.;https://forestecosyst.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40663-018-0147-x;;Vol.5 is.1;Thomson  Reuters ISI

Our main aim is to question the role of “participation” in such a context and particularly, to decouple the operative function of participation from its normative function. Structurally, we argue that the construction of a joint vision of desired energy futures must be understood as a deliberate attempt at governing the energy transition by way of governing the expectations of the actors and systems involved in it. Participatory approaches can promote the co-construction of such energy futures in the form of a boundary-object, able to resonate with and provide a common reference to the actors participating in its creation. On the other hand, participatory approaches can also be a way to make transitions more democratic, subjecting it to a broader influence and control from the citizenship. These two functions of “participation” are always potentially at odds with one another. Democratizing the transition, in fact, would require producing plural, dynamical imaginaries that are responsive and accountable to the public. On the contrary, the need to make transitions governable may close-up such imaginaries and narrow-down the participatory efforts to foster their normalization and acceptability on the part of the most influential actors in the self-government of the transition. To refine and exemplify our proposal, we perform a qualitative, exploratory case study of Chile's E2050 energy policy. Our findings show that “participation” may indeed have been used in the case to align partially conflicting expectations around a collectively-defined boundary object which may then act as a form of contextual, anticipatory and polycentric governance of the transition. However, from a democratic perspective, E2050 appears as a tokenization of the public in support of a pre-eminently technical and monolithic vision enacted by the Energy Ministry and the Consultative Committee. Within this context, the actual influence of the public on the policy and the possibility for political contestation are much more questionable.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00134/full;;Vol.6;Thomson  Reuters ESCI

The volume to be granted as permanent and eventual WURs is calculated from streamflow records, if stream gauge data are available, or from hydrologic parameter transfer from gauged to ungauged catchments, usually with less than 50 years of record. To test the per- formance of this allocation system, while analyzing the long-term natural variability in water resources, we investigated a 400 year-long (1590–2015) tree-ring reconstruction of runoff and historical water rights for Perquilauquén at Quella catchment, a tributary to the Maule River in Central Chile (35°S–36°30S). Furthermore, we assess how the current legislation would perform under a projected climate scenario, based on historical climate simulations of runoff calibrated against observed data, and future projections. Our analyses indicate that the allocation methodology currently applied by the Water Authority in Chile is very sensitive to the time window of data used, which leads to an underestimation of variability and long-term trends. According to the WURs database provided by the Chilean Water Directorate, WURs at Perquilauquén at Quella are already over-allocated. Considering regional climate projections, this condition will be exacerbated in the future. Furthermore, serious problems regarding the access and quality of infor- mation on already-granted WURs and actual water usage have been diagnosed, which further encumber environmental strategies to deal with and adapt to climate change. We emphasize the urgent need for a review and revision of current water allocation methodologies and water law in Chile, which are not concordant with the dynamics and non-stationarity of hydrological processes. Water scarcity and water governance are two of the key issues to be faced by Chile in the Anthropocene.;https://www.elementascience.org/article/10.1525/elementa.340/;74;Vol.6 is.1;Thomson  Reuters ISI

New evidence of a multi-decadal drying trend and the impacts of a persistent drought that since 2010 has affected several regions of the country, reinforce the need for clear diagnoses of the hydro-climate changes in Chile. Based on the analysis of long-term records (50+ years) of precipitation and streamflow, we confirm a tendency toward a dryer condition in central-southern Chile (30–48°S). We describe the geographical and seasonal character of this trend, as well as the associated large-scale circulation pat- terns. When a large ensemble of climate model simulations is contrasted to observations, anthropogenic forcing appears as the leading factor of precipitation change. In addition to a drying trend driven by greenhouse gas forcing in all seasons, our results indicate that the Antarctic stratospheric ozone deple- tion has played a major role in the summer rainfall decline. Although average model results agree well with the drying trend’s seasonal character, the observed change magnitude is two to three times larger than that simulated, indicating a potential underestimation of future projections for this region. Under present-day carbon emission rates, the drying pathway in Chile will likely prevail during the next decades, although the summer signal should weaken as a result of the gradual ozone layer recovery. The trends and scenarios shown here pose substantial stress on Chilean society and its institutions, and call for urgent action regarding adaptation measures.;https://www.elementascience.org/article/10.1525/elementa.328/;2;Vol.7 is.1;Thomson  Reuters ISI

This study shows, for the first time, that the East Asian trough (EAT), a prominent circulation feature of the mid-troposphere in the downstream side, might exert a strong and significant role on the interannual variability of the Euro-Mediterranean climate during boreal winters. We performed empirical orthogonal function analysis on the regions of the EAT and Mediterranean trough (MedT), an important system modulating the climate of the region, to obtain the respective dominant modes of variability at 500-hPa geopotential heights. It appears that the leading modes, the intensity in the case of the EAT and the zonal displacement in the case of the MedT, are significantly correlated with each other (r = − 0.64, p < 0.001). Consequently, when the EAT is strong (weak), the MedT is observed in the west (east) of its climatological location resulting in a warmer (cooler) Middle East and northeastern Africa, a cooler (warmer) western Europe and northwestern Africa, and wetter (dryer) Italian, Balkan and Anatolian peninsulas. Given the fact that the EAT is also a key determinant of the East Asian winter climate, the identified mid-tropospheric link between East Asia and Mediterranean could help interpret some temperature and precipitation co-variability on the opposite sides of the Eurasian continent. We suggest that studies involving the Euro-Mediterranean climate should also consider the role of the EAT as it seems to be a potential driver of the year-to-year, perhaps longer-term, climate variability in the region.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00382-018-4573-9;;;Thomson  Reuters ISI

However, the number of “blooming deserts”, their geographical distribution and spatio-temporal patterns have not been quantitatively assessed to date. Here, we used NDVI data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) project to reconstruct the annual land surface phenology (LSP) of the Atacama Desert using a non-parametric statistical approach. From the reconstructed LSP, we detected the “blooming deserts” as positive NDVI anomalies and assessed three dimensions of the events: their temporal extent, intensity of “greening” and spatial extent. We identified 13 “blooming deserts” between 1981 and 2015, of which three (1997–98, 2002–03, and 2011) can be considered major events according to these metrics. The main event occurred in 2011, spanning 180 days between July and December 2011, and spread over 11,136 km 2 of Atacama dry plains. “Blooming deserts” in Atacama have been triggered by the accumulation of precipitation during a period of 2 to 12 months before and during the events. The proposed three-dimensional approach allowed us to characterize different types of “blooming deserts”: with longer episodes or larger spatial distribution or with different “greening” intensities. Its flexibility to reconstruct different LSP and detect anomalies makes this method a useful tool to study these rare phenomena in other deserts in the world also.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0303243418306202;193-203;Vol.76;Thomson  Reuters ISI

It could also affect ecological interactions, particularly pollination and seed dispersal, which play a key role in plant reproduction. We used a tripartite interaction with a mistletoe, its pollinator and its disperser animals to gain insight into this issue. We studied flower and fruit production, and visitation rates during average (2012) and dry (2015) austral summers. Drought in our study area affected precipitation and soil water availability. Although pollinator visits did not significantly differ in these summers, during the dry summer flower and fruit production experienced an important decline, as did seed disperser visits. Also, mistletoe mortality increased from 12% in 2012 to 23% in 2015. This empirical evidence suggests that the cascade effects of climate change may indirectly be hindering ecological interactions in the Valdivian temperate rainforest ecosystem we studied.

L.;Estimation of atmospheric total organic carbon (TOC) – paving the path towards carbon budget closure;Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics;;10.5194/acp-19-459-2019;1680-7324;The atmosphere contains a rich variety of reactive organic compounds, including gaseous volatile organic carbon (VOCs), carbonaceous aerosols, and other organic compounds at varying volatility. Here we present a novel and simple approach to measure atmospheric non-methane total organic carbon (TOC) based on catalytic oxidation of organics in bulk air to carbon dioxide. This method shows little sensitivity towards humidity and near 100% oxidation efficiencies for all VOCs tested. We estimate a best-case hourly precision of 8 ppbC during times of low ambient variability in carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide (CO). As proof of concept of this approach, we show measurements of TOCCCO during August–September 2016 from a coastal city in the southwest United Kingdom. TOCCCO was substantially elevated during the day on weekdays (occasionally over 2 ppm C) as a result of local anthropogenic activity. On weekends and holidays, with a mean (standard error) of 102 (8) ppb C, TOCCCO was lower and showed much less diurnal variability. TOCCCO was significantly lower when winds were coming off the Atlantic Ocean than when winds were coming off land if we exclude the weekday daytime. By subtracting the estimated CO from TOCCCO, we constrain the mean (uncertainty) TOC in Atlantic-dominated air masses to be around 23 ( 8) ppbC during this period. A proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was deployed at the same time, detecting a large range of organic compounds (oxygenated VOCs, biogenic VOCs, aromatics, dimethyl sulfide). The total speciated VOCs from the PTRMS, denoted here as Sum(VOC), amounted to a mean (uncertainty) of 12 ( 3) ppbC in marine air. Possible contributions from a number of known organic compounds present in marine air that were not detected by the PTR-MS are assessed within the context of the TOC budget. Finally, we note that the use of a short, heated sample tube can improve the transmission of organics to the analyzer, while operating our system alternately with and without a particle filter should enable a better separation of semi-volatile and particulate organics from the VOCs within the TOC budget. Future concurrent measurements of TOC, CO, and a more comprehensive range of speciated VOCs would enable a better characterization and understanding of the atmospheric organic carbon budget.;https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/459/2019/;459-471;Vol.19 is.1;Thomson  Reuters ISI

The soils contain up to ∼15% CaCl2. X-ray diffraction indicates the rare minerals sinjarite, schoenite, and tachyhydrite. When water is added, the CaCl2 crust immediately turns white due to an apparent mineralogical phase change from sinjarite to a brine. The surfaces are nearly continuously wet due to the salt’s hygroscopicity. The Ca-enriched soils occur in rare exposures, possibly from shallow groundwater. Unlike the surface of adjacent abundant halite crusts, the CaCl2 outcrops remain continuously wet, with up to 12% water under modern, and essentially rainless, climatic conditions. The wet surface stabilizes the land surface and acts as a dust trap. The sediment began accumulating at ca. 14 ka, contains trace quantities of organic carbon, and has total nitrogen that isotopically reflects significant biologically mediated gaseous losses.

Scenario modelling can inform the possible outcomes of forest conservation policies, especially when the scenarios are rooted in the political dynamics that shaped the current legislation. In Chile, tree farms of non-native Radiata Pine and Eucalyptus provide a fast return on investment. Today, fast-growing plantations compete for land area with forest conservation, putting the unique bundle of ecosystem services provided by the latter at risk. Based on a previous political analysis, we propose scenarios projected to 2030 to compare a business-as-usual scenario with A) a conservation scenario based on strict land use restrictions B) an optimistic conservation scenario; C) an unrestricted industrial land use scenario; and D) a restricted industrial land use scenario. The scenarios differ in terms of the implemented policy instruments and the land area required for each land use. We compared these scenarios in terms of carbon stock, control of erosion and wood production, all of which are relevant in the current Chilean political debate. A conservation scenario (A), that combines incentives and restrictions, would imply the largest increase in native forest and regulation services, namely carbon stock and erosion control. In contrast, an unrestricted industrial land use scenario (C) leads to the worst outcomes in terms of erosion compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This study seeks to link political and economic processes underpinning land use change to environmental outcomes, while contributing to the larger discussion on forest policy, forest transitions and environmental outcomes. © 2019";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837718307518;31-42;vol.84.0 is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

Here, we assess the variability of torrential rainfall during the Late Holocene and its projection into the 21st century at the southern edge of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. The analysis of historical data since the beginning of the 20th century reveals that most (76.5%) alluvial disasters in the southern Atacama Desert (26–30°S) have resulted from extreme rainfall events occurring between March and September under El Niño conditions, and more frequently during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Particular rainfall events under these ocean-climate conditions are associated with the convective phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) near the central-equatorial Pacific, resulting in warmer sea surface temperature (SST) there and in the triggering of persistent/intense Pacific South America (PSA) tropical-extratropical teleconnection patterns which result in blocking of the westerly flow at high latitudes and the subsequent deviation of storm tracks towards central-northern Chile. On a longer timescale, marine sediments from Tongoy Bay (30°S) reveal an increasing trend of stronger runoff by torrential coastal rain since ca. 3500 cal yr BP and even stronger heavy rainfall since ca. 1700 cal yr BP. Highly variable coastal sea surface temperatures in the same time span deduced from the sedimentary record can be explained by intensified southerly winds in connection with stronger alongshore pressure gradients and reduced coastal low-cloud cover. Both storm intensification and increased intensity of upwelling-favorable winds point to a variable climate conditioned by strengthened interannual ENSO and interdecadal ENSO-like variability during the Late Holocene. Climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) indicate a reduction in annual precipitation of 15–30% during the current century, together with an intensification of the storms, such as the alluvial disaster on March 25, 2015 in Atacama. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921818118304995;226-237;vol.175.0 is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

Reloncaví is an estuarine system supporting one of the largest mussels farming production within Northern Chilean-Patagonia. Field-surveys were conducted immediately after the volcanic eruption (23–30 April 2015), one month (May 2015), and five months posterior to the event (September 2015). Water samples were collected from three stations along the fjord to determine greenhouse gases [GHG: methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O)], nutrients [NO 3 − , NO 2 − , PO 4 3− , Si(OH) 4 , sulphate (SO 4 2− )], and carbonate systems parameters [total pH (pHT), temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (O 2 ), and total alkalinity (AT)]. Additionally, the impact of physicochemical changes in the water column on juveniles of the produced Chilean blue mussel, Mytilus chilensis, was also studied. Following the eruption, a large phytoplankton bloom led to an increase in pH T , due to the uptake of dissolved-inorganic carbon in photic waters, potentially associated with the runoff of continental soil covered in volcanic ash. Indeed, high surface SO 4 2− and GHG were observed to be associated with river discharges. No direct evidence of the eruption was observed within the carbonate system. Notwithstanding, a vertical pattern was observed, with an undersaturation of aragonite (Ω Ar &lt; 1) both in brackish surface (&lt;3 m) and deep waters (&gt;10 m), and saturated values in subsurface waters (3 to 7 m). Simultaneously, juvenile mussel shells showed maximized length and weight at 4 m depth. Results suggest a localized impact of the volcanic eruption on surface GHG, nutrients and short-term effects on the carbonate system. Optimal conditions for mussel calcification were identified within a subsurface refuge in the fjord. These specific attributes can be integrated into adaptation strategies by the mussel aquaculture industry to confront ocean acidification and changing runoff conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969719310150;49-61;vol.669.0 is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

The samples were analyzed for spectrally-resolved visible light absorption. For surface snow, the average mass mixing ratio of BC was 15 ng/g in northern Chile (18–33°S), 28 ng/g near Santiago (a major city near latitude 33°S, where urban pollution plays a significant role), and 13 ng/g in southern Chile (33–41°S). The regional average vertically-integrated loading of BC was 207 µg/m 2 in the north, 780 µg/m 2 near Santiago, and 2500 µg/m 2 in the south, where the snow season was longer and the snow was deeper. For samples collected at locations where there had been no new snowfall for a week or more, the BC concentration in surface snow was high (~10–100 ng/g) and the sub-surface snow was comparatively clean, indicating the dominance of dry deposition of BC. Mean albedo reductions due to light-absorbing impurities were 0.0150, 0.0160, and 0.0077 for snow grain radii of 100 µm for northern Chile, the region near Santiago, and southern Chile; respective mean radiative forcings for the winter months were 2.8, 1.4, and 0.6 W/m 2 .

This process has been more intense in the coastal range of south-central%%%Chile due to its soils, which are highly susceptible to erosion, combined with a long history of intensive land use changes during the last century, transitioning from native forest (NF) to agriculture and the more recent establishment of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. exotic tree plantations. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the statuses of soil physical properties over different land cover situations. Historical land cover maps were determined via supervised classifications using the maximum likelihood classifier applied to satellite imagery. Five land use and land cover categories (LULC) were defined according to main land cover transitions associated with active and abandoned forestry operations that have been reported in the region: NF, pine plantation (P), eucalyptus plantation (Eu), early successional (E-S), and secondary successional (S-S). Successional stages were generated using change detection statistics considering changes between 2001 and 2014 maps. Soil samples were collected at%%%three depths in 39 plots that describe the five LULC. High clay contents were found in all%%%the LULC except Eu and P. These sites have shown more signs of degradation, with lower%%%organic matter (SOM) and macropores and higher shear strength (ShS). Soil organic matter was consistent with litter contribution and quality, establishing lower bulk density (Db) for NF and S-S and higher values for Eu and E-S. ShS and dispersion rate (DR) exhibit a correlation with SOM with lower ShS and higher DR when SOM increased. Relevant differences were identified for structural stability index (SSI) between LULC depending on soil physical quality, besides a positive correlation with SOM.

The midlatitude SE Pacific is a key region in this regard in terms of understanding the climatic linkages between the tropics and southern high latitudes. Multicentennial timescale temperature variability remains, however, poorly understood, due to a lack of long, high-temporal-resolution temperature records from this region and from the southern high latitudes in general. We present a unique alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) record from 44°S on the southern Chilean margin in the SE Pacific spanning the last 2,300 years at decadal resolution. The record displays relatively large changes including a cooling transition from 14 to 12.5 °C between 1,100 and 600 cal yr BP, in line with other Chile margin SST records and coeval with Antarctic cooling. This cooling is attributable to reduced Southern Ocean deep convection, driven by a late Holocene sea-ice increase in the Weddell Sea associated with increased El-Niño Southern Oscillation variability. Superimposed on the late Holocene cooling, we observe multicentennial timescale SST variability, including relatively cool SSTs (12.5 °C) from 950 to 500 cal yr BP, corresponding to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and warmer SSTs (13 °C) from 500 to 200 cal yr BP, corresponding to the Little Ice Age. These oscillations may reflect either multicentennial internal variability of the Southern Ocean deep convection and/or multicentennial variability in the phasing of El-Niño Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode events. ©2019.

This review highlights recent insights from past warm climates and historical trends that can inform our understanding of monsoon evolution in the context of an emerging energetic framework. Recent Findings: Projections consistent with paleoclimate evidence and theory indicate expanded/wetter monsoons in Africa and Asia, with continued uncertainty in the Americas. Twentieth century observations are not congruent with expectations of monsoon responses to radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, due to the confounding effect of aerosols. Lines of evidence from warm climate analogues indicate that while monsoons respond in globally coherent and predictable ways to orbital forcing and inter-hemispheric thermal gradients, there are differences in response to these forcings and also between land and ocean. Summary: Further understanding of monsoon responses to climate change will require refinement of the energetic framework to incorporate zonal asymmetries and the use of model hierarchies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40641-019-00125-y;;vol. is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, attributes for assessing the success of forest restoration through natural regeneration may vary among them in spatial patterns depending on the scale of analysis and on environmental gradients. Here we analysed the spatial patterns of recovery completeness (i.e. how similar attributes in restored forests are to the same attributes in reference forests) in response to environmental factors in a Mediterranean forest landscape of Central Chile. We evaluated (1) forest recovery completeness using basal area (BA), quadratic mean diameter (QMD), adult species density (ASD), adult species richness (ASR), and seedling species richness (SSR); (2) the spatial congruence of recovery completeness estimated by each of these indicators; and (3) the environmental factors potentially shaping these spatial patterns. We used field measurements and geospatial information sources to quantify and predict indicator responses by fitting boosted regression tree models. To assess the spatial congruence of predictions we overlaid high-level recovery completeness values for all indicators. Overall recovery completeness in the study area was 72.7%, suggesting positive prospects for attaining fully restored forests. Recovery completeness had a resulted higher for diversity (92.3%−99.6%) than structural forest attributes (33.5%−76.9%); however, spatial congruence among recovery indicators was low due to the uneven spatial responses of each indicator. The maximum potential spatial congruence was<10%, and was predicted only by two environmental variables (soil bulk density and slope). Our results suggest that low spatial congruence among forest recovery indicators may hinder the monitoring of restoration at large scales. The implications of such divergence in defining restoration success can be enormous given the current global challenge of forest restoration. Although our research was tested in a threatened region of global importance, our results may have wider significance for restoration planning providing cautionary notes and recommendations for the appropriate use of forest recovery indicators when monitoring large-scale restoration projects.";https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X19302274;752-759;vol.102.0 is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

However, only a few regions around the world are currently undergoing precipitation changes that can be attributed to climate change. Knowing when such changes are projected to emerge outside natural variability—the time of emergence (TOE)—is critical for taking effective adaptation measures. Using ensemble climate projections, we determine the TOE of regional precipitation changes globally and in particular for the growing areas of four major crops. We find relatively early (<2040) emergence of precipitation trends for all four crops. Reduced (increased) precipitation trends encompass 1–14% (3–31%) of global production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean. Comparing results for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 clearly shows that emissions compatible with the Paris Agreement result in far less cropped land experiencing novel climates. However, the existence of a TOE, even under the lowest emission scenario, and a small probability for early emergence emphasize the urgent need for adaptation measures. We also show how both the urgency of adaptation and the extent of mitigation vary geographically.;http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1811463116;6673-6678;vol.116.0 is.14.0;Thomson Reuters ISI

The ichnological analysis confidently assigns the trace to the ichnospecies Hominipes modernus—a hominoid footprint usually related to Homo sapiens.

To reduce uncertainties in oceanic N2O emission estimates and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in N2O distributions in a changing ocean, we propose the establishment of a harmonized N2O Observation Network (N2O-ON) combining discrete and continuous data from various platforms. The network will integrate observations obtained by calibrated techniques, using time series measurements at fixed stations and repeated hydrographic sections on voluntary observing ships and research vessels. In addition to exploiting existing oceanographic infrastructure, we propose the establishment of central calibration facilities in selected international laboratories to improve accuracy, and ensure standardization and comparability of N2O measurements. Final data products will include a harmonized global N2O concentration and emission fields for use in model validation and projections of future oceanic N2O emissions, to inform the global research community and policy makers.;https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2019.00157/full;157;vol.6.0 is.;Thomson Reuters ISI

Race; Santoro, Calogero M.; Capriles, José M.; Gayo, Eugenia M.; Latorre, Claudio";In-stream wetland deposits, megadroughts, and cultural change in the northern Atacama Desert, Chile;Quaternary Research;;10.1017/qua.2018.122;0033-5894;A key concern regarding current and future climate change is the possibility of sustained droughts that can have profound impacts on societies. As such, multiple paleoclimatic proxies are needed to identify megadroughts, the synoptic climatology responsible for these droughts, and their impacts on past and future societies. In the hyperarid Atacama Desert of northern Chile, many streams are characterized by perennial flow and support dense in-stream wetlands. These streams possess sequences of wetland deposits as fluvial terraces that record past changes in the water table. We mapped and radiocarbon dated a well-preserved sequence of in-stream wetland deposits along a 4.3-km reach of the Río San Salvador in the Calama basin to determine the relationship between regional climate change and the incision of in-stream wetlands. The Río San Salvador supported dense wetlands from 11.1 to 9.8, 6.4 to 3.5, 2.8 to 1.3, and 1.0 to 0.5 ka and incised at the end of each of these intervals. Comparison with other in-stream wetland sequences in the Atacama Desert, and with regional paleoclimatic archives, indicates that in-stream wetlands responded similarly to climatic changes by incising during periods of extended drought at ~9.8, 3.5, 1.3, and 0.5 ka.;https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0033589418001229/type/journal_article;63-80;vol.91.0 is.1.0;Thomson Reuters ISI
