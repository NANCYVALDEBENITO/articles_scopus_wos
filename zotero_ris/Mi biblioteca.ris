AB  - This study documents the mean properties and variability of kinematic and precipitation structures associated with orographic precipitation along the coast of Northern California in the context of terrain-trapped airflows (TTAs). TTAs are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. Seven land-falling winter storms are examined with observations from a scanning X-band Doppler radar deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California. Additional information is provided by a 915-MHz wind-profiling radar, surface meteorology, a GPS receiver, and balloon soundings. The composite kinematic structure during TTA conditions exhibits a significant horizontal gradient of wind direction from the coast to approximately 50 km offshore and a low-level jet (LLJ) that surmounts a weaker airflow offshore corresponding to the TTA, with a zone of enhanced precipitation evident between ~5 and 25 km offshore and oriented nearly parallel to the coastline. Conversely, the composite kinematic structure during NO-TTA conditions exhibits a smaller offshore horizontal gradient of wind direction and precipitation structures are generally enhanced within ~15 km of the coastline. Interstorm variability analysis reveals significant variations in kinematic structures during both TTA and NO-TTA conditions, whereas significant variations in precipitation structures are only evident during TTA conditions. The interstorm analysis also illustrates more clearly how LLJ vertical structures evident during NO-TTA conditions exhibit ascent along the coast and over the coastal mountains, which is in contrast to TTA conditions where the ascent occurs offshore and over the TTA.

AB  - “The Tarapacá Declaration” draws attention to the urgent need to change how human societies have been using water in the Atacama Desert, based on a historical trajectory spanning several millennia. The Declaration, an initiative that summarizes the results of the CONICYT/PIA, Anillo project SOC1405, is oriented towards civil society and various political entities, aiming to generate technological and cultural changes to halt and mitigate the effects caused by anthropogenic activities in one of the oldest and most arid deserts in the world. In the course of the project, we established the urgent need to sensitize society to the wasteful overuse and misuse of water in the Atacama Desert, a non-renewable resource in relation to the economic scales of extraction of this element that depends, fundamentally, on fossil waters that have accumulated for millennia in the highlands of the Desert. In this way we want to avoid that this scientific knowledge is encapsulated in the universities and to echo the point made by Victoria Castro (2003): that to grow you have to educate.

AB  - Numerical prediction of aerosol particle properties has become an important activity at many research and operational weather centers. This development is due to growing interest from a diverse set of stakeholders, such as air quality regulatory bodies, aviation and military authorities, solar energy plant managers, climate services providers, and health professionals. Owing to the complexity of atmospheric aerosol processes and their sensitivity to the underlying meteorological conditions, the prediction of aerosol particle concentrations and properties in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) framework faces a number of challenges. The modeling of numerous aerosol-related parameters increases computational expense. Errors in aerosol prediction concern all processes involved in the aerosol life cycle including (a) errors on the source terms (for both anthropogenic and natural emissions), (b) errors directly dependent on the meteorology (e.g., mixing, transport, scavenging by precipitation), and (c) errors related to aerosol chemistry (e.g., nucleation, gas-aerosol partitioning, chemical transformation and growth, hygroscopicity). Finally, there are fundamental uncertainties and significant processing overhead in the diverse observations used for verification and assimilation within these systems. Indeed, a significant component of aerosol forecast development consists in streamlining aerosol-related observations and reducing the most important errors through model development and data assimilation. Aerosol particle observations from satellite- and ground-based platforms have been crucial to guide model development of the recent years and have been made more readily available for model evaluation and assimilation. However, for the sustainability of the aerosol particle prediction activities around the globe, it is crucial that quality aerosol observations continue to be made available from different platforms (space, near surface, and aircraft) and freely shared. This paper reviews current requirements for aerosol observations in the context of the operational activities carried out at various global and regional centers. While some of the requirements are equally applicable to aerosol-climate, the focus here is on global operational prediction of aerosol properties such as mass concentrations and optical parameters. It is also recognized that the term "requirements" is loosely used here given the diversity in global aerosol observing systems and that utilized data are typically not from operational sources. Most operational models are based on bulk schemes that do not predict the size distribution of the aerosol particles. Others are based on a mix of "bin" and bulk schemes with limited capability of simulating the size information. However the next generation of aerosol operational models will output both mass and number density concentration to provide a more complete description of the aerosol population. A brief overview of the state of the art is provided with an introduction on the importance of aerosol prediction activities. The criteria on which the requirements for aerosol observations are based are also outlined. Assimilation and evaluation aspects are discussed from the perspective of the user requirements.

T2  - La política del ambiente en América Latina: una aproximación desde el cambio ambiental global
AB  - A partir de la década de 1970, la educación ambiental ha sido una herramienta fundamental para enfrentar la crisis socioambiental global generada por los actuales modos de desarrollo capitalistas, incorporándose en las agendas públicas de organismos internacionales y de gobiernos de diversos países. En Chile se reconoce que la educación ambiental emerge en la década de 1990, a partir de iniciativas formales e informales, permanentes y transitorias, autogestionadas y dependientes de instituciones públicas o privadas. Este capítulo está centrado en el ámbito de la educación formal y surge de una investigación que tuvo por objetivo describir y analizar –desde una perspectiva no lineal y situada en el sur del país– los procesos de territorialización de la política pública de educación ambiental en Chile, a partir de uno de sus instrumentos principales: el Sistema Nacional de Certificación Ambiental de Establecimientos Educacionales (SNCAE). A partir de metodologías de investigación social cualitativa, revisión documental y trabajo etnográfico multisituado, nos aproximamos a actores involucrados en la operación de las políticas y el SNCAE en el plano global, nacional, regional y local. Esta metodología permitió reconocer y analizar procesos de institucionalización e internalización, entendidos como modos específicos de territorialización de la política pública, reconociendo en las escuelas rurales de la comuna de Panguipulli, en la región de Los Ríos (sur de Chile), un espacio de contacto entre las iniciativas de educación ambiental emanadas desde las instituciones globales y nacionales, y aquellas que son resignificadas desde las comunidades educativas según sus propios modos de relacionarse con el territorio. A la luz de la investigación, nos parece interesante describir y reconocer los modos en que la educación ambiental se incorpora a la educación formal desde los espacios regionales, para comprender en forma situada las representaciones y condiciones de posibilidad que surgen para el cambio ambiental local en territorios distantes del norte global y del centro nacional.

AB  - Santiago (33.5°S, 70.5°W), the capital of Chile, is frequently affected by extreme air pollution events during wintertime deteriorating air quality (AQ) and thus affecting the health of its population. Intense residential heating and on-road transport emissions combined with poor circulation and vertical mixing are the main factors responsible for these events. A modelling system composed of a chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) and a meteorological model (WRF) was implemented to assess the AQ impacts of residential and transportation sources in the Santiago basin. A two-week period of July 2015 with various days with poor AQ was simulated focusing on the impact on AQ with respect to fully inhalable particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Three emission scenarios, within the range of targeted reductions of the decontamination plan of Santiago, were tested; namely 50% reduction of residential emission, 50% reduction of transport emissions and the combination of both. An additional scenario decreasing transport emissions in 10% was carried out to examine whether a linear dependence of surface concentrations on changes in emissions exists.

The system was validated against surface and vertically resolved meteorological measurements. The model reproduces the daily surface concentration variability from the AQ monitoring network of Santiago. However, the model not fully captures the emissions variations inferred from the observations which may be due to missing sources such as resuspension of dust.

Results show that, during the period studied, although both residential and transportation sources contribute to observed AQ levels in Santiago, reducing transport emissions is more effective in terms of reducing the number of days with pollution events than decreasing residential combustion. This difference in impact is largely due to the spatial distribution of the emission sources. While most of the residential combustion is emitted in the outskirts of the city, most of the transport emissions occur within the city, where most of the stations from AQ monitoring network of Santiago are located. As can be expected, the largest improvement of AQ in Santiago is achieved by the combined reduction of emissions in both sectors. Sensitivity analysis with 10% reduction in transport emissions reveals a linear behavior between emissions and concentrations for NOX and approximate linear behavior for PM2.5. The absence of secondary aerosols formation and dust resuspension in the current simulation could explain this deviation from linearity for fine particles. Nevertheless, it suggests that the results can be used for mitigation policies with emissions reductions below the 50% used in this study.

AB  - In the Porcelana Hot Spring (Northern Patagonia), true-branching cyanobacteria are the dominant primary producers in microbial mats, and they are mainly responsible for carbon and nitrogen fixation. However, little is known about their metabolic and genomic adaptations at high temperatures. Therefore, in this study, a total of 81 Fischerella thermalis strains (also known as Mastigocladus laminosus) were isolated from mat samples in a thermal gradient between 61–46 °C. The complementary use of proteomic comparisons from these strains, and comparative genomics of F. thermalis pangenomes, suggested that at least two different ecotypes were present within these populations. MALDI-TOF MS analysis separated the strains into three clusters; two with strains obtained from mats within the upper temperature range (61 and 54 °C), and a third obtained from mats within the lower temperature range (51 and 46 °C). Both groups possessed different but synonymous nifH alleles. The main proteomic differences were associated with the abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins. Three F. thermalis metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were described from 66, 58 and 48 °C metagenomes. These pangenomes indicated a divergence of orthologous genes and a high abundance of exclusive genes at 66 °C. These results improved the current understanding of thermal adaptation of F. thermalis and the evolution of these thermophilic cyanobacterial species.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
AB  - This work presents and studies the efficiency problem of mapping GPU threads onto simplex domains. A non-linear map λ(ω) is formulated based on a block-space enumeration principle that reduces the number of thread-blocks by a factor of approximately 2× and 6× for 2-simplex and 3-simplex domains, respectively, when compared to the standard approach. Performance results show that λ(ω) is competitive and even the fastest map when ran in recent GPU architectures such as the Tesla V100, where it reaches up to 1.5× of speedup in 2-simplex tests. In 3-simplex tests, it reaches up to 2.3× of speedup for small workloads and up to 1.25× for larger ones. The results obtained make λ(ω) a useful GPU optimization technique with applications on parallel problems that define all-pairs, all-triplets or nearest neighbors interactions in a 2-simplex or 3-simplex domain.

Although the rich variety of possibilities for supporting collaboration among the users of virtual museums, today very few implementations offer support for such kind of activities. This paper aims at settling the value of collaboration in virtual museums by means of depicting and classifying collaborative organization and co-curation activities in establishing, designing, planning, realizing, operating, deploying and visiting a virtual exhibition applying action research. As a use case, we present ongoing work to realize a virtual museum devoted to Armenian cross stones (Khachkars).

AB  - This paper is the first in a series, presenting a new galaxy cluster finder based on a three-dimensional Voronoi
Tesselation plus a maximum likelihood estimator, followed by gapping-filtering in radial velocity(VoML+G). The
scientific aim of the series is a reassessment of the diversity of optical clusters in the local universe. A mock galaxy
database mimicking the southern strip of the magnitude(blue)-limited 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), for
the redshift range 0.009 < z < 0.22, is built on the basis of the Millennium Simulation of the LCDM cosmology
and a reference catalog of “Millennium clusters,” spannning across the 1.0 × 1012–1.0 × 1015 Me h−1 dark matter
(DM) halo mass range, is recorded. The validation of VoML+G is performed through its application to the mock
data and the ensuing determination of the completeness and purity of the cluster detections by comparison with the
reference catalog. The execution of VoML+G over the 2dFGRS mock data identified 1614 clusters, 22% with
Ng  10, 64 percent with 10 > Ng  5, and 14% with Ng < 5. The ensemble of VoML+G clusters has a ∼59%
completeness and a ∼66% purity, whereas the subsample with Ng  10, to z ∼ 0.14, has greatly improved mean
rates of ∼75% and ∼90%, respectively. The VoML+G cluster velocity dispersions are found to be compatible
with those corresponding to “Millennium clusters” over the 300–1000 km s−1 interval, i.e., for cluster halo masses
in excess of ∼3.0 × 1013 Me h−1

AB  - A fast and sensitive method for the continuous determination of methane (CH4) and its stable carbon isotopic values (δ13C‐CH4) in surface waters was developed by applying a vacuum to a gas/liquid exchange membrane and measuring the extracted gases by a portable cavity ring‐down spectroscopy analyser (M‐CRDS). The M‐CRDS was calibrated and characterized for CH4 concentration and δ13C‐CH4 with synthetic water standards. The detection limit of the M‐CRDS for the simultaneous determination of CH4 and δ13C‐CH4 is 3.6 nmol L−1 CH4. A measurement precision of CH4 concentrations and δ13C‐CH4 in the range of 1.1%, respectively, 1.7‰ (1σ) and accuracy (1.3%, respectively, 0.8‰ [1σ]) was achieved for single measurements and averaging times of 10 min. The response time τ of 57 ± 5 s allow determination of δ13C‐CH4 values more than twice as fast than other methods. The demonstrated M‐CRDS method was applied and tested for Lake Stechlin (Germany) and compared with the headspace‐gas chromatography and fast membrane CH4 concentration methods. Maximum CH4 concentrations (577 nmol L−1) and lightest δ13C‐CH4 (−35.2‰) were found around the thermocline in depth profile measurements. The M‐CRDS‐method was in good agreement with other methods. Temporal variations in CH4 concentration and δ13C‐CH4 obtained in 24 h measurements indicate either local methane production/oxidation or physical variations in the thermocline. Therefore, these results illustrate the need of fast and sensitive analyses to achieve a better understanding of different mechanisms and pathways of CH4 formation in aquatic environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:
Published algorithms for classification of human sperm heads are based on relatively small image databases that are not open to the public, and thus no direct comparison is available for competing methods. We describe a gold-standard for morphological sperm analysis (SCIAN-MorphoSpermGS), a dataset of sperm head images with expert-classification labels in one of the following classes: normal, tapered, pyriform, small or amorphous. This gold-standard is for evaluating and comparing known techniques and future improvements to present approaches for classification of human sperm heads for semen analysis. Although this paper does not provide a computational tool for morphological sperm analysis, we present a set of experiments for comparing sperm head description and classification common techniques. This classification base-line is aimed to be used as a reference for future improvements to present approaches for human sperm head classification.

METHODS:
The gold-standard provides a label for each sperm head, which is achieved by majority voting among experts. The classification base-line compares four supervised learning methods (1- Nearest Neighbor, naive Bayes, decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and three shape-based descriptors (Hu moments, Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors), reporting the accuracy and the true positive rate for each experiment. We used Fleiss' Kappa Coefficient to evaluate the inter-expert agreement and Fisher's exact test for inter-expert variability and statistical significant differences between descriptors and learning techniques.

RESULTS:
Our results confirm the high degree of inter-expert variability in the morphological sperm analysis. Regarding the classification base line, we show that none of the standard descriptors or classification approaches is best suitable for tackling the problem of sperm head classification. We discovered that the correct classification rate was highly variable when trying to discriminate among non-normal sperm heads. By using the Fourier descriptor and SVM, we achieved the best mean correct classification: only 49%.

CONCLUSIONS:
We conclude that the SCIAN-MorphoSpermGS will provide a standard tool for evaluation of characterization and classification approaches for human sperm heads. Indeed, there is a clear need for a specific shape-based descriptor for human sperm heads and a specific classification approach to tackle the problem of high variability within subcategories of abnormal sperm cells.

AB  - The year 2015 was, at the time, the warmest since 1880, and many regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) registered record breaking annual temperatures. Simultaneously, a remarkable and widespread growing season greening was observed over most of the NH in the record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). While the response of vegetation to climate change (i.e. the long term trend) is assumed to be predictable, it is still unclear whether it is also possible to predict the interannual variability in vegetation activity.

Here, we evaluate whether the unprecedented magnitude and extent of the greening observed in 2015 corresponds to an expected response to the 2015 climate anomaly, or to a change in the sensitivity of NH vegetation to climate. We decompose NDVI into the long-term and interannual variability components, and find that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) explain about half of NDVI interannual variability. This response is in addition to the long-term temperature and human-induced greening trend. We use a simple statistical approach to predict the NDVI anomaly in 2015, using the PDO and AMO states as predictors for interannual variability, and temperature and precipitation trends for the long-term component.

We show that the 2015 anomaly can be predicted as an expected vegetation response to temperature and water-availability associated with the very strong state of the PDO in 2015. The link found between climate variability patterns and vegetation activity should contribute to increase the predictability of carbon-cycle processes at interannual time-scales, which may be relevant, for instance, for optimizing land-management strategies.

AB  - Background and objective: Infertility is a problem that affects up to 15% of couples worldwide with emotional and physiological implications and semen analysis is the first step in the evaluation of an infertile couple. Indeed the morphology of human sperm cells is considered to be a clinical tool dedicated to the fertility prognosis and serves, mainly, for making decisions regarding the options of assisted reproduction technologies. Therefore, a complete analysis of not only normal sperm but also abnormal sperm turns out to be critical in this context. This paper sets out to develop, implement and calibrate a novel methodology to characterize and classify sperm heads towards morphological sperm analysis. Our work is aimed at focusing on a depth analysis of abnormal sperm heads for fertility diagnosis, prognosis, reproductive toxicology, basic research or public health studies.

Methods: We introduce a morphological characterization for human sperm heads based on shape measures. We also present a pipeline for sperm head classification, according to the last Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen of the World Health Organization (WHO). In this sense, we propose a two-stage classification scheme that permits to classify sperm heads among five different classes (one class for normal sperm heads and four classes for abnormal sperm heads) combining an ensemble strategy for feature selection and a cascade approach with several support vector machines dedicated to the verification of each class. We use Fisher's exact test to demonstrate that there is no statistically significant differences between our results and those achieved by domain experts.

Results: Experimental evaluation shows that our two-stage classification scheme outperforms some state-of-the-art monolithic classifiers, exhibiting 58% of average accuracy. More interestingly, on the subset of data for which there is a total agreement between experts for the label of the samples, our system is able to provide 73% of average classification accuracy.

Conclusions: We show that our system behaves like a human expert; therefore it can be used as a supplementary source for labeling new unknown data. However, as sperm head classification is still a challenging issue due to the uncertainty on the class label of each sperm head, with the consequent high degree of variability among domain experts, we conclude that there are still opportunities for further improvement in designing a more accurate system by investigating other feature extraction methods and classification schemes.

T2  - Limnologica
AB  - The exchange of matter and energy between confined components of aquatic ecosystems requires the passage through their interfaces. This passage is characterized by rapid changes in physical, chemical and biological conditions and often triggers chemical transformations that involve the exchange of electrons: redox reactions.

Over the last decades, research in aquatic biogeochemistry has resulted in many new but conceptually isolated findings that, together, frame an emergent view on the overarching principles of aquatic redox processes. A thermodynamic assessment may reveal the maximum available energy from such redox reactions. However, this energy can rarely be released due to various morphological, ecological and kinetic constrains on the turnover reactions. As these constrains set the boundary conditions for aquatic ecosystem functioning, they deserve particular attention in freshwater research.

Here, we illustrate how physical and structural traits shape a complex redox environment and how this environment ultimately exercises control on the inhabiting microbial community and its metabolism. This aquatic microbiome is the key entity of material turnover. At the same time, the biome possesses the capability to feed back on its environment by shaping the local redox conditions and sustain niche existences. We discuss current and emerging ideas of how microorganisms engineer their environment, affecting aquatic redox reactions. In total, we examine this feed-back cycling between the physical environment and its colonizing biome to encourage the reader to take on the redox perspective when analyzing processes at aquatic interfaces. Understanding electron fluxes on both temporal and spatial scales is essential for the overall comprehension of matter and energy fluxes through freshwater environments. We pinpoint the methodological frontiers that will need to be challenged in future studies of aquatic redox processes. An improved mechanistic understanding will be instrumental in estimating sink and source properties of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Contemporary society shows an increasing demand for participatory instances able to effectively foster
the collaboration of diverse organizational, disciplinary and socio-cultural areas. The challenges intrinsic
to such participatory instancesrequire the development of methodologies that may allow for the insertion
of reflexivity within the dialogical interaction, while also promoting the collective construction of
"boundary objects": such objects, in turn, by serving as a common reference for the different perspectives
involved in the dialogue, have the potential of facilitating the future collaboration among such
perspectives. To respond to these demands -and inspired by the notion of metalogue originally introduced
by Gregory Bateson- this paper elaborates a systemic-constructivist proposal of observation and
contextual intervention, aimed at fostering reflexivity within dialogical-participatory instances by inducing
their participants to perform a second-order observation of the distinctions mobilized within the
interaction. Building upon this reflexivity, the metalogue pursues the co-construction of documents able
to coordinate the perspectives of the participants and the expectations of the structural and organizational
arrangements in which they operate. In addition to justifying and describing the technique of the
metalogue, the paper highlights some lessons learned, good practices and proposals derived from its
application in various transdisciplinary experiences in Chile.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - The degree to which vegetation and site type have influenced fire regimes through the Holocene has not been investigated in detail in the temperate ecosystems of southern Patagonia. Here we present a first attempt using a paired-basin approach to study the evolution of fire regimes in sectors dominated by humid Nothofagus forests and the xeric Patagonian steppe in the Magallanes region of Chilean Patagonia (51°S). We analyzed sediment cores from two small lakes and a bog located within the same climate zone on opposite sides of the forest-steppe ecotone, ~28 km apart. The position of this biological boundary east of the Andes is controlled by the strength and position of the southern westerly winds, which constitute the sole source of precipitation throughout western Patagonia. Our results indicate that fires have occurred in the study region repeated times over the last ~13,000 years at bi- and tridecadal timescales. Sectors currently dominated by Patagonian steppe feature high frequency and low magnitude of local fires, and vice versa in humid forests. Climate-driven expansion of Nothofagus scrubland/woodland into steppe environments over the last ~4,200 years increased the magnitude and lowered the frequency of fire events, culminating with peak Nothofagus abundance, fire magnitude and frequency during the last millennium. We also detect divergences between lake-based vs. bog-based paleofire histories among paired sites located within the Patagonian steppe, ~12 km apart, which we attribute to local burning of the bog at times of lowered water table. This divergence suggests to us that bog-based vegetation and fire histories exacerbate a local, azonal, signal blurring extra-local or regional regimes, thus accounting for some discrepancies in the Quaternary paleovegetation/paleoclimate literature of southern Patagonia.

AB  - The long-term history of fire regimes in the Mediterranean Andes of Chile is almost unknown. Subalpine woodlands of Austrocedrus chilensis include long-lived trees resilient to low-intensity fires, which can provide valuable tree-ring-based information about fire history. In this work, we performed an annually resolved multicentury reconstruction of past fires from fire-scar records identified in relict Austrocedrus wood found on steep highly-eroded and rocky slopes with coarser fuel structure in the upper Cachapoal Valley, central Andes of Chile. We compared this fire record with historical land-use changes and extensive reconstructions of regional precipitation and temperature, as well as large-scale climatic patterns. The highest fire frequencies were recorded in the Spanish settlement period (1541–1750), when land-clearing activities, cattle ranching, agriculture, and mining practices became widespread after the Spanish conquest. At an interannual time scale, fire occurrence and precipitation were unconnected during the Spanish settlement. By contrast, in the indigenous period (1200–1540), under the influence of the aboriginal Chiquillanes people, fires occurred in wet years with high vegetation productivity. In the livestock grazing period (1751–1950), when large cattle ranches were established, fires occurred in dry years after a wet year. Fires in this period were likely ignited under conditions of high fuel flammability to improve plant production and promote intensive livestock grazing. At a multidecadal time scale, fires were more frequent in cold periods throughout the whole record. These findings suggest that herbaceous fuel accumulation and flammability, modulated by climate variation and human land uses, were the main factors promoting fires spread in this Mediterranean subalpine area. Our research emphasizes the importance of relict Austrocedrus wood for fire history reconstruction and expands knowledge about fire regime shifts over the past eight centuries in southern South America.

AB  - . Emission inventories are the quantification of pollutants
from different sources. They provide important information
not only for climate and weather studies but also for
urban planning and environmental health protection. We developed
an open-source model (called Vehicular Emissions
Inventory – VEIN v0.2.2) that provides high-resolution vehicular
emissions inventories for different fields of studies.
We focused on vehicular sources at street and hourly levels
due to the current lack of information about these sources,
mainly in developing countries.
The type of emissions covered by VEIN are exhaust (hot
and cold) and evaporative considering the deterioration of
the factors. VEIN also performs speciation and incorporates
functions to generate and spatially allocate emissions
databases. It allows users to load their own emission factors,
but it also provides emission factors from the road transport
model (Copert), the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Brazilian databases. The VEIN model
reads, distributes by age of use and extrapolates hourly traffic
data, and it estimates emissions hourly and spatially. Based
on our knowledge, VEIN is the first bottom–up vehicle emissions
software that allows input to the WRF-Chem model.
Therefore, the VEIN model provides an important, easy and
fast way of elaborating or analyzing vehicular emissions inventories
under different scenarios. The VEIN results can be
used as an input for atmospheric models, health studies, air
quality standardizations and decision making.

T2  - Journal of Marine Systems
AB  - Dissolved O2 (DO) concentration is critical to determining ecosystem functions such as organic matter respiration, which can favor fixed nitrogen loss and the accumulation of compounds such as NH4+. This dynamic is observed in central Chile's coastal upwelling system (36 °S), which presents seasonally O2 deficient waters and high biological productivity. Temporal dynamics for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO3−, NO2− and NH4+) are analyzed based on a ten year time series of monthly measurements of DO and DIN and a three year record of absolute DIN uptake rates (ρDIN), respective turnover rates (νDIN), and O2 utilization rates (OUR). Observed O2 deficit gradually increases from hypoxia to near anoxia as the system becomes more productive, favoring the accumulation of NO2− and NH4+. Three temporal phases within the aphotic layer were distinguished: (I) DO > 62 μmol L−1 (May to August), (II) 5 < DO < 62 μmol L−1 (September to December) and (III) DO < 5 μmol L−1 (January to April). From phase I to III, DO and NO3− inventories decreased by eight and two times, respectively, while NH4+ and NO2 inventories increased two- and five-fold, respectively. Uptake rates for NH4+ varied from 0.23 to 450 nmol N L−1 d−1 and from 1.42 to 184 nmol N L−1 d−1 for NO3−. Notably, integrated ρNH4+ increased during phase III, generating a NH4+ turnover time of 12–29 days; whereas integrated ρNO3− peaked during phase II, and removed the NO3− pool over an extended turnover time (>820 days). Integrated OUR gradually increased from phase I to III (from 225 to 422 mmol m−2 d−1), with DO pools replenished over 2.3 to 26 days. NH4+ regeneration rates ranged from 34 to 62 mmol m−2 d−1 and NH4+ pools were replenished within a few days. Variation in DO, which regulates N cycling, may explain the accumulation of N-species within the aphotic layer. Observed trends could be extrapolated to scenarios of upwelling-favorable winds, eutrophication and hypoxia.

AB  - Phytoplankton biomass during the austral summer is influenced by freezing and melting cycles as well as oceanographic processes that enable nutrient redistribution in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Microbial functional capabilities, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic activities as well as inorganic 13C- and 15N-assimilation rates were studied in the surface waters of Chile Bay during two contrasting summer periods in 2014. Concentrations of Chlorophyll a (Chla) varied from 0.3 mg m−3 in February to a maximum of 2.5 mg m−3 in March, together with a decrease in nutrients; however, nutrients were never depleted. The microbial community composition remained similar throughout both sampling periods; however, microbial abundance and activity changed with Chla levels. An increased biomass of Bacillariophyta, Haptophyceae and Cryptophyceae was observed along with night-grazing activity of Dinophyceae and ciliates (Alveolates). During high Chla conditions, HCO3− uptake rates during daytime incubations increased 5-fold (>2516 nmol C L−1 d−1), and increased photosynthetic transcript numbers that were mainly associated with cryptophytes; meanwhile night time NO3− (>706 nmol N L−1 d−1) and NH4+ (41.7 nmol N L−1 d−1) uptake rates were 2- and 3-fold higher, respectively, due to activity from Alpha-/Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteriia). Due to a projected acceleration in climate change in the WAP, this information is valuable for predicting the composition and functional changes in Antarctic microbial communities.

NPP and NPPE rates varied from 0.03 to 18.29 and from 0.45 to 9.07 g C m−2 d−1, respectively. Both rates were fairly well correlated with each other (r2 = 0.61), but when these data were separated into two periods, higher r2 value was found during winter (r2 = 0.70) with respect to the rest of the year (r2 = 0.24); the latter correlation was partially due to increased weekly NPPE variability during active and relaxed upwelling events. NPP rates along with other biophysical variables allowed for a division of the annual cycle into three distinct periods: September to January (high productivity, mean integrated NPP rates of 4.0 g C m−2 d−1), February to March (intermediate productivity, mean integrated NPP rates of 1.4 g C m−2 d−1), and May to August (basal level, mean integrated NPP rates of 0.5 g C m−2 d−1). NPP appeared to be partially controlled by nutrient inputs, either from upwelling (September-April) and river discharge (May-August), maintaining high NPP rates throughout the entire year, with an annual mean NPP rate of 1.1 kg C m−2 yr−1. In this region, El Niño Southern Oscillation events did not appear to impact the NPP interannual variability.

TI  - Potential benefits of a block-space GPU approach for discrete tetrahedral domains
AU  - Navarro, Cristobal A.

AB  - The study of data-parallel domain re-organization and thread-mapping techniques are relevant topics as they can increase the efficiency of GPU computations on spatial discrete domains with non-box-shaped geometry. In this work we study the potential benefits of applying a succinct data re-organization of a tetrahedral data-parallel domain of size O(n3) combined with an efficient block-space GPU map of the form g (λ) : N → N3. Results from the analysis suggest that in theory the combination of these two optimizations produce significant performance improvement as block-based data reorganization allows a coalesced one-to-one correspondence at local thread-space while g(λ) produces an efficient block-space spatial correspondence between groups of data and groups of threads, reducing the number of unnecessary threads from O(n3) to O(n2ρ3) with ρ ϵ O(1). From the analysis, we obtained that a block based succinct data re-organization can provide up to 2× improved performance over a linear data organization while the map can be up to 6× more efficient than a bounding box approach. The results from this work can serve as a useful guide for a more efficient GPU computation on tetrahedral domains found in spin lattice, finite element and special n-body problems, among others.

TI  - Using archaeological shell middens as a proxy for past local coastal upwelling in northern Chile

T2  - Quaternary International
AB  - Shell middens, large heaps of refuse materials that are often interspersed with burials, hearths and other cultural features, provide important data regarding the lifestyles of past coastal and maritime dwellers. Despite the abundance of organic materials, radiocarbon ages from shell middens can be a challenge to interpret because marine shells are depleted in radiocarbon with respect to their contemporaneous atmosphere, known as the “reservoir effect” (R). This issue is particularly problematic in regions like the coastal Atacama Desert where the upwelling of subsurface radiocarbon-depleted waters creates a shell “local” reservoir effect (ΔR) with a time-variable intrinsic uncertainty. Here we review and discuss how the dating of diverse materials from these deposits, including the shells themselves, can reveal large shifts between the terrestrial (atmospheric) and marine carbon cycles. Furthermore, a chronology of such shifts can be used as a proxy of upwelling intensity and to help establish the duration of strong versus weak local upwelling episodes. To test and evaluate these ideas, we present a chronology of R and ΔR variations from a 2-m shell midden sequence from Caleta Vitor in northern Chile that spans the middle Holocene, which remains underrepresented by regional ΔR values. The ∼2000 y sequence of Caleta Vitor, located onshore from a major upwelling center, displays dramatic shifts in radiocarbon reservoir effects which we hypothesize are linked to strong changes in the intensity of local upwelling. Further replication of such archaeomalacological records will be key for not only solving methodological problems regarding the dating of coastal sites but can provide further insights into the evolving terrestrial and marine carbon cycles and how these relate to past climate change.

T2  - Journal of Transport Geography
AB  - Public transport systems with electronic fare collection devices continuously store data related to trips taken by users, which contain valuable information for planning and policy analysis. However, if the card is not personalized, there is no socioeconomic information available, which imposes a limitation on the types of analysis that can be performed. This work presents a simple method to estimate the residence zone of card users, which will allow socioeconomic variables to be estimated, thereby enriching the analytical possibilities. The method, which is based on the observation of morning transactions of frequent users, is applied to a sample of over 2 million cards. The method is evaluated using a sample from the Santiago ODS where users declared their card id and also declared their home address. A sample of 888,970 cards that are observed at least three days in a week and show spatial regularity for the morning transaction is used for zone of residence estimation and analysis of travel patterns and time use. The results show that users who live in the city center or in the wealthier East zone experience lower travel time, spend more time at home and less time at work.

AB  - Flowpaths are significantly affected by land use change and engineered elements across urban catchments. Conventional GIS-based tools for extracting drainage networks were not developed for urban terrains. This work presents Geo-PUMMA, a GIS toolbox to generate vectorial meshes for terrain representation in distributed hydrological modeling, and to extract drainage patterns in urban and peri-urban catchments. Geo-PUMMA generates well-shaped Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) and Urban Hydrological Elements (UHEs). The toolbox was used in peri-urban catchments of Chile and France to generate three model meshes with different levels of treatment, and extract and compare their corresponding drainage networks. A recommended mesh is identified, which replicates the main morphological and hydrological features of the reference drainage network, and is able to preserve features at small to medium spatial scales (∼80–150 m). Overall Geo-PUMMA can be used to represent the terrain in distributed hydrological modeling applied to urban and peri-urban scales.

AB  - Mexico City is a large city, populated by 8.8 million inhabitants. This population density, combined with poor wastewater management, results in aquatic ecosystems receiving a large volume of wastewater which may promote methane (CH4) emission. We measured water quality and CH4 emission from 11 aquatic ecosystems in Mexico City during 1 year, including reservoirs, rivers, lakes, canals and chinampas (system of floating garden on shallow lakes). The total CH4 emission from aquatic ecosystems was estimated as 3679 Mg CH4 year−1, which represents 3.5 % of the annual CH4 emission of Mexico City. The main contributors are chinampas (33 %), followed by lakes (27 %), reservoirs (19 %), rivers (12 %) and canals (9 %). Water quality indicators were positively correlated with CH4 emission, therefore a decrease in untreated wastewater discharge may result in a significant reduction of the greenhouse gas footprint of Mexico City, after a transitional period during which the organic content of the sediment would be degraded.

AB  - This work studies the problem of GPU thread mapping for a Sierpiński gasket fractal embedded in a discrete Euclidean space of n × n. A block-space map λ : ZE2 → ZF2 is proposed, from Euclidean parallel space E to embedded fractal space F, that maps in O(log2 log2(n)) time and uses no more than O(nH) threads with H ≈ 1.58 . . . being the Hausdorff dimension, making it parallel space efficient. When compared to a bounding-box map, λ(ω) offers a sub-exponential improvement in parallel space and a monotonically increasing speedup once n > n0. Experimental performance tests show that in practice λ(ω) can produce performance improvement at any block-size once n > n0 = 28, reaching approximately 10× of speedup for n = 216 under typical block configurations.

AB  - Among the few well established changes in atmospheric circulation in recent decades are those caused by stratospheric ozone depletion. They include a strengthening and poleward contraction of the westerly atmospheric circulation over the Southern extratropics, i.e. a strengthening Southern Annular Mode (SAM), in austral spring and summer. Associated effects on extratropical temperature and precipitation and more recently subtropical precipitation have been documented and are understood in a zonal mean framework. We present zonally asymmetric effects of ozone depletion that reach into the tropics and affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation, including the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the most important rainband of the Southern Hemisphere. Using observation-based analyses and model simulations we show that over the 1961–1996 period, ozone depletion led to increased precipitation at the northern flank of the SPCZ and to decreased precipitation to the south. The effects originate from a flow pattern over the southwestern Pacific that extends equatorward and alters the propagation of synoptic waves and thus the position of the SPCZ. Model simulations suggest that anticipated stratospheric ozone recovery over the next decades will reverse these effects.

AB  - The 2008 eruption of Volcán Chaitén (VCha) in northwestern Patagonia was the first explosive rhyolitic eruption to have occurred within a century and provided an unprecedented scientific opportunity to examine all facets of the eruption ranging from magma rheology/ascent rates to ash-fall effects on biota and infrastructure. Up to very recently it was thought that the latest eruption prior to the 2008 event occurred c. 9750 cal. a BP. Although a number of researchers have recognised additional eruptive products, but their stratigraphy, age, and geochemical attributes have not been systematically described and/or recorded. In this study, we provide a detailed examination of andic cover-beds and tephra-bearing lake sequences located both proximally and distally to VCha, which record a series of hitherto unknown rhyolitic eruptive products and place all previous observations firmly within a coherent stratigraphic framework. Through major- and trace-element glass shard geochemistry we are able to confidently verify eruptive source. A total of 20 discrete tephra beds are recognised, with at least 10 having widespread areal distributions and/or depositional imprints broadly comparable to, or greater than, the 2008-tephra event. This record indicates that VCha has been continuously but intermittently active as far back as the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 18,000 cal a BP) with two dominant, genetically related magma types and an intermediary ‘mixed’ type. Before this the eruptive record has been largely obscured and/or erased by widespread Andean piedmont glaciation. However, based on the tempo of VCha activity over the last c. 18,000 years, older VCha eruptives can be anticipated to occur as well as future hazardous explosive events. The new eruptive inventory will ultimately be useful for correlating equivalent-aged sequences and refining long-term eruptive tempo as well as corresponding temporal changes in magmatic evolution.

AB  - We describe the stratigraphy, age and correlation of a prominent tephra marker, named Lepué Tephra, extensively distributed in north‐western Patagonia. Lepué Tephra is well dated at c. 11 000 cal a BP from numerous lake and soil cover‐bed sequences and its recognition is useful for assessing the rate and timing of deglaciation as well as associated environmental changes in this region during the last glacial termination and early Holocene. Lepué Tephra has attributes typical of a complex and compositionally zoned phreatomagmatic eruptive. While the initial rhyolitic phase can be readily distinguished from multiple eruptive products sourced from the adjacent Volcán Chaitén, the main erupted end member is of basaltic–andesitic bulk composition − similar to younger tephras sourced from Holocene monogenetic cones adjacent to the Volcán Michimahuida massif (tMim). Lepué Tephra can be correlated to an equivalent‐aged pyroclastic flow deposit (Amarillo Ignimbrite) prominently distributed in the south‐eastern sector of tMim. The source vent for these co‐eruptive events is obscured by an extensive ice field and is currently unknown. The widespread radially symmetrical distribution of Lepué Tephra centred on tMim cannot be attributed solely to volcanological considerations. Reduced Southern Hemisphere westerly wind influence interpreted from climate proxies at the time of eruption are also implicated.

AU  - Valenzuela, Raul A.
AU  - Kingsmill, David E.
T2  - Monthly Weather Review
AB  - This study develops an objective method of identifying terrain-trapped airflows (TTAs) along the coast of Northern California and documenting their impact on orographic rainfall. TTAs are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. A 13-winter-seasons dataset is employed, including observations from a 915-MHz wind profiling radar along the coast at Bodega Bay (BBY, 15 m MSL) and surface meteorology stations at BBY and in the coastal mountains at Cazadero (CZD, 478 m MSL). A subset of rainy hours exhibits a profile with enhanced vertical shear and an easterly wind maximum in the lowest 500 m MSL, roughly the same depth as the nearby coastal terrain. Both flow features have a connection to TTAs along the coast of Northern California. Based on the average orientation (320°–140°) and altitude of nearby topography, mean wind direction in the lowest 500 m MSL () between 0°–140° is used as the initial criterion to identify TTA conditions. Application of this threshold yields a CZD/BBY rainfall ratio of 1.4 (3.2) for TTA (NO TTA) conditions. More detailed analysis of the relationship between and orographic rainfall reveals that an upper threshold of 150° more precisely divides the TTA and NO-TTA regimes. A sensitivity analysis and comparison with a TTA documented in a previous case study show that the best TTA identification criteria correspond to  with a duration of at least 2 h. This objective identification method is applied to seven case studies in Part II of the present study.

AU  - Delgado, Verónica

T2  - Water Resources Management
AB  - The hypothesis of the present work is that the groundwater regulations of the Chilean Water Code are insufficient because they look only at quantitative aspects of interest to owners of water rights, but do not serve to protect the quality of the aquifer as a common good. To prove this hypothesis, a legal and technical review of how groundwater catchment protection areas are regulated in Spanish and US law, especially when used for human consumption, was carried out. After this review, we contrasted these regulations with Chilean standards, particularly the Water Code and Supreme Decree 203 of 2013. We concluded that there are at least two substantial differences: a) Chilean legislation does not impose any restrictions on the establishment of polluting activities near the drinking water collection point, emphasizing the quantity of the resource rather than the protection of its quality. The law prevents only the opening of new groundwater collection points near the first. In addition, b) the protection area is not variable; it always remains the same regardless of the intended objective, site characteristics or the speed at which a contaminant advances.

T2  - Science of The Total Environment
AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a biological process that plays an important role in reducing the CH4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems. Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes are recognized as significant contributors to global methane (CH4) emission, since CH4 production is increasing as permafrost thaws and provides fuels for methanogenesis. Methanotrophy, including AOM, is critical to reducing CH4 emissions. The identity, activity, and metabolic processes of anaerobic methane oxidizers are poorly understood, yet this information is critical to understanding CH4 cycling and ultimately to predicting future CH4 emissions. This study sought to identify the microorganisms involved in AOM in sub-Arctic lake sediments using DNA- and phospholipid-fatty acid (PLFA)- based stable isotope probing. Results indicated that aerobic methanotrophs belonging to the genus Methylobacter assimilate carbon from CH4, either directly or indirectly. Other organisms that were found, in minor proportions, to assimilate CH4-derived carbon were methylotrophs and iron reducers, which might indicate the flow of CH4-derived carbon from anaerobic methanotrophs into the broader microbial community. While various other taxa have been reported in the literature to anaerobically oxidize methane in various environments (e.g. ANME-type archaea and Methylomirabilis Oxyfera), this report directly suggest that Methylobacter can perform this function, expanding our understanding of CH4 oxidation in anaerobic lake sediments.

AB  - This paper presents a new algorithm to find under-dense regions called voids inside a 2D point set. The algorithm starts from terminal-edges (local longest-edges) in a Delaunay triangulation and builds the largest possible low density terminal-edge regions around them. A terminal-edge region can represent either an entire void or part of a void (subvoid). Using artificial data sets, the case of voids that are detected as several adjacent subvoids is analyzed and four subvoid joining criteria are proposed and evaluated. Since this work is inspired on searches of a more robust, effective and efficient algorithm to find 3D cosmological voids the evaluation of the joining criteria considers this context. However, the design of the algorithm permits its adaption to the requirements of any similar application.

AB  - A novel parallel simulation algorithm on the GPU, implemented in CUDA and C++, is presented for the simulation of Brownian particles that display excluded volume repulsion and interact with long and short range forces. When an explicit Euler–Maruyama integration step is performed to take into account the pairwise forces and Brownian motion, particle overlaps can appear. The excluded volume property brings up the need for correcting these overlaps as they happen, since predicting them is not feasible due to the random displacement of Brownian particles. The proposed solution handles, at each time step, a Delaunay triangulation of the particle positions because it allows us to efficiently solve overlaps between particles by checking just their neighborhood. The algorithm starts by generating a periodic Delaunay triangulation of the particle initial positions on CPU, but after that the triangulation is always kept on GPU memory. We used a parallel edge-flip implementation to keep the triangulation updated during each time step, checking previously that the triangulation was not rendered invalid due to the particle displacements. We designed and implemented an exact long range force simulation with an all-pairs -body simulation, tiling the particle interaction computations based on the warp size of the target device architecture. The resulting implementation was validated with two models of active colloidal particles, also showing a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude when compared to a sequential implementation. A short range forces simulation using Verlet lists for neighborhood handling was also developed and validated, showing similar performance improvements.

AB  - Advancing computational thinking in elementary education has been rapidly gaining attention due to the prospective of developing 21st century skills. However, interventions in this domain risk failure if they do not explicitly address the particular socio-cultural traits of the deployment scenario. This is the case in most countries of Latin America, where computing has not reached a sustainable penetration in K-12 education. In order to bridge this gap, we designed a one-week workshop for advancing computational thinking targeted to 10-12 years old Chilean students with no prior experience in programming. This paper describes our intervention and presents the results of a qualitative study analyzing positive and negative aspects of the experience. Although most participants effectively acquired basic programming skills by the end of the intervention, we also identified several inaccurate views on computing and computer scientists. For instance, computing was mostly perceived as a set of informal experiences rather than a way for enabling creation, automation, and work. The word "hacking" appears to be used as a metaphor for more technical terms, such as "programming" or "algorithm". Finally, negative stereotypical views of computer scientists resulting from the intervention were not as frequent as initial perceptions. These results provide fresh evidence on how to design, adapt, and evaluate computational thinking interventions targeted to K-6 students in Latin America.

AB  - Many fields of study, including medical imaging, granular physics, colloidal physics, and active matter, require the precise identification and tracking of particle-like objects in images. While many algorithms exist to track particles in diffuse conditions, these often perform poorly when particles are densely packed together—as in, for example, solid-like systems of granular materials. Incorrect particle identification can have significant effects on the calculation of physical quantities, which makes the development of more precise and faster tracking algorithms a worthwhile endeavor. In this work, we present a new tracking algorithm to identify particles in dense systems that is both highly accurate and fast. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by analyzing images of dense, solid-state granular media, where we achieve an identification error of 5% in the worst evaluated cases. Going further, we propose a parallelization strategy for our algorithm using a GPU, which results in a speedup of up to  when compared to a sequential CPU implementation in C and up to  when compared to the reference MATLAB library widely used for particle tracking. Our results extend the capabilities of state-of-the-art particle tracking methods by allowing fast, high-fidelity detection in dense media at high resolutions.

AB  - Net methane (CH4) emission from lakes depends on two antagonistic processes: CH4 production (methanogenesis) and CH4 oxidation (methanotrophy). It is unclear how climate warming will affect the balance between these processes, particularly among lakes of different trophic status. Here we show that methanogenesis is more sensitive to temperature than methanotrophy, and that eutrophication magnifies this temperature sensitivity. Using laboratory incubations of water and sediment from ten tropical, temperate and subarctic lakes with contrasting trophic states, ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, we explored the temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. We found that both processes presented a higher temperature sensitivity in tropical lakes, followed by temperate, and subarctic lakes; but more importantly, we found that eutrophication triggered a higher temperature sensitivity. A model fed by our empirical data revealed that increasing lake water temperature by 2 °C leads to a net increase in CH4 emissions by 101–183% in hypereutrophic lakes and 47–56% in oligotrophic lakes. We conclude that climate warming will tilt the CH4 balance towards higher lake emission and that this impact will be exacerbated by the eutrophication of the lakes.

AB  - South Westland, New Zealand, and southern Chile, are two narrow continental corridors effectively confined between the Pacific Ocean in the west and high mountain ranges in the east which impart significant influence over regional climate, vegetation and soils. In both these southern mid-latitude regions, evidence for extensive and repeated glaciations during cold phases of the Quaternary is manifested by arrays of successively older glacial drift deposits with corresponding outwash plain remnants. In South Westland, these variably aged glacial landforms are mantled by layered (multisequal) soils characterised by slow loess accretion and pedogenesis in an extreme leaching and weathering environment. These cover-bed successions have undergone repeated coupled phases of topdown and upbuilding soil formation that have been related to fluctuating cycles of interglacial/warm and glacial/cold climate during the Quaternary. In this study, we recognise multisequal soils overlying glacial landforms in southern continental Chile but, unlike the spodic (podzolic) soil sequences of South Westland, these are of dominantly volcanigenic (andic) provenance and are very similar to multisequal soils of andic provenance that predominate in, and adjacent to, areas of rhyolitic to andesitic volcanism in North Island, New Zealand. Here we develop a soil-stratigraphic model to explain the observed occurrence of multisequal soils mantling dominantly glacial landforms of southern continental Chile. Based on proxy data from southern Chile, we propose that persistent vegetation cover and high precipitation on the western side of the Andes, during colder-than-present episodes tended to suppress the widespread production of glacially-derived loessial materials despite the pervasive occurrence of glacial and glacio-fluvial deposits that have frequently inundated large tracts of this landscape during the Quaternary. Given the lack of loess cover-beds that have traditionally assisted in the relative dating of glacial episodes prior to the Late Quaternary, surface exposure dating techniques could provide another chronological alternative to address this issue. However, there have been two main obstacles to successfully apply this dating technique in Patagonia. First, minimum exposure ages may be obtained on moraines older than the last glacial cycle due to erosion, although dating outwash plains is more robust. Second, on the wet western side adjacent to the Andes, persistent vegetation cover during both glacial and post-glacial times, as well as widespread inundation by volcanic mass-flows, appear preventive. We make a case that soil genesis within this region appears to be dominated by a constant flux of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra which has continued to upbuild soils at the ground surface separated by intervals where topdown weathering processes are intensified. As already demonstrated by New Zealand studies, multisequal soil successions have a clear implied connection to coupled glacial and interglacial climate cycles of the Quaternary. On this basis, similar sequences in northwest Patagonia provide a relatively untapped archive to enable Quaternary glacial and environmental changes in this pervasively glaciated volcanic region to be constructed.

AB  - Streamflow in south-central Chile (SCC,  ∼  37–42° S) is vital for agriculture, forestry production, hydroelectricity, and human consumption. Recent drought episodes have generated hydrological deficits with damaging effects on these activities. This region is projected to undergo major reductions in water availability, concomitant with projected increases in water demand. However, the lack of long-term records hampers the development of accurate estimations of natural variability and trends. In order to provide more information on long-term streamflow variability and trends in SCC, here we report findings of an analysis of instrumental records and a tree-ring reconstruction of the summer streamflow of the Río Imperial ( ∼  37° 40′ S–38° 50′ S). This is the first reconstruction in Chile targeted at this season. Results from the instrumental streamflow record ( ∼  1940 onwards) indicated that the hydrological regime is fundamentally pluvial with a small snowmelt contribution during spring, and evidenced a decreasing trend, both for the summer and the full annual record. The reconstruction showed that streamflow below the average characterized the post-1980 period, with more frequent, but not more intense, drought episodes. We additionally found that the recent positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode has significantly influenced streamflow. These findings agree with previous studies, suggesting a robust regional signal and a shift to a new hydrological scenario. In this paper, we also discuss implications of these results for water managers and stakeholders; we provide rationale and examples that support the need for the incorporation of tree-ring reconstructions into water resources management.

AB  - During the summer of 2017, several megafires in South-Central Chile burned down forest plantations, native forests, shrublands and human settlements. National authorities identified the relevant effects of the wildfires on infrastructure and ecosystems. However, other indirect effects such as the risk of flooding or, increased air pollution were not assessed. The present study assesses: i) the geographic characterization of wildfires, ii) amount of damage to ecosystems and the severity of wildfires, iii) the effects of megafires on air quality in nearby and distant urban areas, and iv) identification of cities potentially exposed to landslides and flooding. We ran remote sensing analyses based on the Normalized Burn Ratio taken from Landsat imagery, “active fires” from MODIS, and ASTER GDEM. The particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) levels measured on 34 Chilean's municipalities were correlated with the burning area/distance ratio by Spearman correlation. Socionatural hazards were evaluated using multi-criteria analyses combining proximity to burned areas, severity, potential flow of water and sediments as indicated by the Digital Elevation Model, drainage networks and the location of human settlements. 91 burned areas were identified, covering 529,794 ha. The most affected ecosystems were forest plantations and native shrublands. We found significant correlations between burned area/distance ratios and PM2.5 and PM10 levels, leading to increased levels over the Chilean air quality standard in the most populated cities. 37 human settlements were at increased risk of landslides and flooding hazards after fires and eleven could now be characterized as dangerously exposed. The 2017 wildfires in Chile have had an impact at both a small and large scale, with far-reaching air pollutants dispersing and affecting >74% of the Chilean population. The impact of the wildfires was also extended over time, creating future potential for landslides and flooding, with the risk increasing in rainy seasons.

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - The relationship between scientific knowledge and decision-making surrounding environmental issues is complex and represents a flourishing area of scholarship and practice. However, a sense of frustration persists regarding efforts to increase the use of science for decision-making. Regulations of copper smelter arsenic emissions developed in Chile during the 1990s represent a successful example of science informing policy making. The case involved production and use of local science in contrast to the common practice of copying international ambient standards. 
In this paper, we investigate arsenic regulation in Chile in the 1990s and focus on the role of the major science intervention during the process, project FONDEF2-24. The case is examined through the lens of knowledge governance (van Kerkhoff and Pilbeam, 2017). This theoretically-oriented approach guides our critical reflection on the relationship between knowledge and policy making, taking into consideration the formal and informal rules that shape the intervention and the underlying social and cultural patterns. The success of the science intervention’s influence on policy is better understood with such a perspective. 
We expand the knowledge governance approach by scrutinizing the relations of coherence between levels of analysis to assess their alignment. The approach could be helpful for studying other cases, particularly at times when a new field of policy is emerging.

AB  - Antarctica is recognized as being geopolitically and scientifically important, and as one of the regions with the greatest potential to affect and be affected by global climate change. Still, little is known in practice about how climate change will be handled within the main governance framework of the continent: the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Using qualitative interviews, participant observations and policy document analysis, this paper explores the perspectives of Chilean scientific, political and non-governmental actors regarding the implications of climate change for the current Antarctic governance framework. Results corroborate a misalignment of the climate change agenda and the ATS, stemming from the divergent views displayed by a wide network of actors. From the interviews, two predominant visions emerge: (i) climate change as an opportunity, where actors recognize the role of Antarctica in regulating global climate and stress greater opportunities to conduct Antarctic-based climate change research, the need for strategic international collaboration, and the reinforcement of Chile’s position in Antarctica through science; (ii) climate change as a burden where actors acknowledge climate change as a global problem, largely external to Antarctica, express disbelief regarding the effectiveness of local actions to tackle climate change and do not associate with climate change governance. The study concludes that climate change may become a dividing, rather than a unifying, field of action in Chilean Antarctic governance, reinforcing previously existing geopolitical tendencies.

AB  - We examine the response of Nothofagus forests to climate change and disturbance regimes over the last 3200 years near Coyhaique (45°S), central–east Chilean Patagonia, using fine‐resolution pollen and charcoal records from lake sediment cores. Closed‐canopy deciduous Nothofagus forests have dominated the region with little variation until the arrival of Chilean–European settlers, suggesting a predominance of cool‐temperate and wet conditions. Within this state we identify centennial‐scale episodes of forest fragmentation, increase in littoral macrophytes and volcanic/paleofire disturbance between 2700 and 3000 cal a BP, 2200 and 2500 cal a BP and over the last ∼250 years, which we interpret as intervals with negative hydrologic balance. Natural variability caused little impact on the physiognomy and composition of the vegetation in pre‐European time, in contrast to the accelerated shift that started during the late 19th century associated with deforestation, homogenization and synchronization of ecosystem changes at the landscape level, and spread of exotic plant species brought by Chilean and European settlers during a warm/dry interval. The resilience of deciduous Nothofagus forests to natural disturbance regimes and climate change was exceeded by large‐scale human disturbance since the late 19th century by fire, timber exploitation and livestock grazing. These disturbances caused an ecosystem shift towards artificial meadows and scrublands with frequent high‐magnitude fires.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres
AB  - A record‐setting temperature of 17.5°C occurred on 24 March 2015 at the Esperanza station located near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). We studied the event using surface station data, satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and numerical simulations. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Antarctic Ice Shelf Image Archive provides clear evidence for disintegration and advection of sea ice, as well as the formation of melt ponds on the ice sheet surface at the base of the AP mountain range. A deep low‐pressure center over the Amundsen‐Bellingshausen Sea and a blocking ridge over the southeast Pacific provided favorable conditions for the development of an atmospheric river with a northwest‐southeast orientation, directing warm and moist air toward the AP, and triggering a widespread foehn episode. A control simulation using a regional climate model shows the existence of local topographically induced warming along the northern tip of the AP (∼60% of the full temperature signal) and the central part of the eastern AP (>90% of the full temperature signal) with respect to a simulation without topography. These modeling results suggest that more than half of the warming experienced at Esperanza can be attributed to the foehn effect (a local process), rather than to the large‐scale advection of warm air from the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, the local foehn effect also has a large‐scale advection component, since the atmospheric river provides water vapor for orographic precipitation enhancement and latent heat release, which makes it difficult to completely disentangle the role of local versus large‐scale processes in explaining the extreme event.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Climate change affects consumer expenditures by altering the consumption of and price for electricity. Previous analyses focus solely on the former, which implicitly assumes that climate-induced changes in consumption do not affect price. But this assumption is untenable because a shift in demand alters quantity and price at equilibrium. Here we present the first empirical estimates for the effect of climate change on electricity prices. Translated through the merit order dispatch of existing capacity for generating electricity, climate-induced changes in daily and monthly patterns of electricity consumption cause non-linear changes in electricity prices. A 2 °C increase in global mean temperature increases the prices for and consumption of electricity in Massachusetts USA, such that the average household’s annual expenditures on electricity increase by about 12%. Commercial customers incur a 9% increase. These increases are caused largely by higher prices for electricity, whose impacts on expenditures are 1.3 and 3.6 fold larger than changes in residential and commercial consumption, respectively. This suggests that previous empirical studies understate the effects of climate change on electricity expenditures and that policy may be needed to ensure that the market generates investments in peaking capacity to satisfy climate-driven changes in summer-time consumption.

AB  - Worldwide, urbanization constitutes a major and growing driver of global change and a distinctive feature of the Anthropocene. Thus, urban development paths present opportunities for technological and societal transformations towards energy efficiency and decarbonization, with benefits for both greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollution mitigation. This requires a better understanding of the intertwined dynamics of urban energy and land use, emissions, demographics, governance, and societal and biophysical processes. In this study, we address several characteristics of urbanization in Santiago (33.5°S, 70.5°W, 500 m a.s.l.), the capital city of Chile. Specifically, we focus on the multiple links between mobility and air quality, describe the evolution of these two aspects over the past 30 years, and review the role scientific knowledge has played in policy-making. We show evidence of how technological measures (e.g., fuel quality, three-way catalytic converters, diesel particle filters) have been successful in decreasing coarse mode aerosol (PM10) concentrations in Santiago despite increasing urbanization (e.g., population, motorization, urban sprawl). However, we also show that such measures will likely be insufficient if behavioral changes do not achieve an increase in the use of public transportation. Our investigation seeks to inform urban development in the Anthropocene, and our results may be useful for other developing countries, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean where more than 80% of the population is urban.

AB  - This paper is the first of a series of four GMD papers on the PMIP4-CMIP6 experiments. Part 2 (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017) gives details about the two PMIP4-CMIP6 interglacial experiments, Part 3 (Jungclaus et al., 2017) about the last millennium experiment, and Part 4 (Kageyama et al., 2017) about the Last Glacial Maximum experiment. The mid-Pliocene Warm Period experiment is part of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) – Phase 2, detailed in Haywood et al. (2016).

The goal of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) is to understand the response of the climate system to different climate forcings for documented climatic states very different from the present and historical climates. Through comparison with observations of the environmental impact of these climate changes, or with climate reconstructions based on physical, chemical, or biological records, PMIP also addresses the issue of how well state-of-the-art numerical models simulate climate change. Climate models are usually developed using the present and historical climates as references, but climate projections show that future climates will lie well outside these conditions. Palaeoclimates very different from these reference states therefore provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art models and a way to assess whether their sensitivity to forcings is compatible with palaeoclimatic evidence. Simulations of five different periods have been designed to address the objectives of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6): the millennium prior to the industrial epoch (CMIP6 name: past1000); the mid-Holocene, 6000 years ago (midHolocene); the Last Glacial Maximum, 21 000 years ago (lgm); the Last Interglacial, 127 000 years ago (lig127k); and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, 3.2 million years ago (midPliocene-eoi400). These climatic periods are well documented by palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records, with climate and environmental changes relevant for the study and projection of future climate changes. This paper describes the motivation for the choice of these periods and the design of the numerical experiments and database requests, with a focus on their novel features compared to the experiments performed in previous phases of PMIP and CMIP. It also outlines the analysis plan that takes advantage of the comparisons of the results across periods and across CMIP6 in collaboration with other MIPs.

AB  - In developing countries, the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) rests on the hands of millions of small landowners that coexist with large properties, in a reality of highly unequal land distribution. Guiding the effective allocation of ES-based incentives in such contexts requires researchers and practitioners to tackle a largely overlooked question: for a given targeted area, will single large farms or several small ones provide the most ES supply? The answer to this question has important implications for conservation planning and rural development alike, which transcend efficiency to involve equity issues. We address this question by proposing and testing ES supply-area relations (ESSARs) around three basic hypothesized models, characterized by constant (model 1), increasing (model 2), and decreasing increments (model 3) of ES supply per unit of area or ES “productivity”. Data to explore ESSARs came from 3384 private landholdings located in southern Chile ranging from 0.5 ha to over 30,000 ha and indicators of four ES (forage, timber, recreation opportunities, and water supply). Forage provision best fit model 3, which suggests that targeting several small farms to provide this ES should be a preferred choice, as compared to a single large farm. Timber provision best fit model 2, suggesting that in this case targeting a single large farm would be a more effective choice. Recreation opportunities best fit model 1, which indicates that several small or a single large farm of a comparable size would be equally effective in delivering this ES. Water provision fit model 1 or model 2 depending on the study site. The results corroborate that ES provision is not independent from property area and therefore understanding ESSARs is a necessary condition for setting conservation incentives that are both efficient (deliver the highest conservation outcome at the least cost) and fair for landowners.

AB  - In this study, in situ, real-time and high-resolution vertical measurements of dissolved greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and nutrients are reported for the eastern South Pacific (ESP); a region with marked zonal gradients, ranging from highly productive and suboxic conditions in coastal upwelling systems to oligotrophic and oxygenated conditions in the subtropical gyre. Four high-resolution vertical profiles for gases (N2O and CH4) and nutrients (NO−3 and PO3−4) were measured using a Pumped Profiling System (PPS), connected with a liquid degassing membrane coupled with Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) and a nutrient auto-analyzer, respectively. The membrane-CRDS system maintains a linear response over a wide range of gas concentrations, detecting N2O and CH4 levels as low as 0.0774 ± 0.0004 and 0.1011 ± 0.001 ppm, respectively. Continuous profiles for gases and nutrients were similar to those reported throughout the ESP, with pronounced N2O and CH4 peaks at the upper oxycline and at the base of the euphotic zone and pycnocline, respectively, in the coastal zone; but almost constant depth profiles in the subtropical gyre. Additionally, other vertical gas and nutrient structures were observed using continuous sampling, which would not have been detected by discrete sampling. Our results demonstrate that continuous measurements can be a potentially useful methodology for future GHGs cycle studies.

AB  - Los procesos de degradación de bosques, tanto por alteraciones intensivas (explotación de bosques a tala rasa, sustitución por otras clases de uso del suelo, incendios, etc.) como por alteraciones que pueden ser de baja intensidad (ganadería, tala selectiva, etc.) han sido ampliamente estudiados en diversos ecosistemas forestales. Estos factores de alteración, en especial la ganadería y la tala selectiva o floreo, se ha demostrado que cambian la diversidad y composición de especies de plantas, lo que puede a su vez influenciar la funcionalidad de la comunidad y del ecosistema. Sin embargo, menos atención se ha dado a comprender cómo la regeneración de especies forestales responde a tales alteraciones. En Chile la mayor parte de los bosques nativos se encuentran expuestos a una actividad ganadera irregular, siendo utilizados como fuente de forraje y refugio en especial en la temporada invernal. Esta actividad se realiza incluso en poblaciones de especies amenazadas o en ecosistemas de alto valor de conservación, sin evaluar el potencial impacto que el ganado pueda tener en la persistencia de las especies de flora. En este capítulo se presentan diversos antecedentes que demuestran la extrema urgencia de regular la actividad ganadera en bosques nativos, más aún cuando éstos son expuestos simultáneamente a otras actividades productivas como la tala selectiva. A partir del análisis de la influencia del ganado en la regeneración forestal se proponen aproximaciones de investigación y métodos silvícolas para evaluar, regular y monitorear la ganadería forestal. Esto es especialmente relevante al considerar que el ganado constituye la principal fuente de ingreso de miles de familias campesinas. Un mayor control en pequeñas y medianas propiedades podría generar una mayor presión de ganadería ilegal en las grandes propiedades de difícil control perimetral, incluyendo áreas protegidas del Estado. Para orientar una adecuada planificación y regulación de la actividad ganadera en bosques nativos resultados como los expuestos en este capítulo debiesen ser considerados en la legislación ambiental. Por ejemplo, considerar que los impactos de la ganadería en los ecosistemas dependen también del estado sucesional de los bosques, lo que debiese ser incluido en los esquemas de manejo evaluados por la Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF). Ello permitiría regular una actividad que, como se presenta en este capítulo, tiene notables influencias en los ecosistemas forestales. Es también necesario reconocer la variable vocación productiva de los territorios, con diferentes potencialidades y limitaciones que hacen necesaria una política regional acorde con los intereses y características locales

Estos factores resultan claves para incrementar la importancia del cambio climático en la agenda pública, favorecer un mayor involucramiento ciudadano y fortalecer la resiliencia individual, social e institucional, así como el im pacto de las políticas. No obstante, en Chile el estudio de los aspectos psicológicos del cambio climático es muy limitado.  Por su extensión este trabajo se presenta en dos partes.

AB  - This article focuses on self-organizing processes in contested urban social-ecological systems. It analyzes a wetland conservation program and civic management effort in the Angachilla sector of the city of Valdivia, Chile in a 15-year time frame. The aim is to understand what triggers collective actions and self-organization in the attempts of preserving an urban green common. The study uses a qualitative approach based on action-research methodologies. It examines key variables influencing self-organizing processes; including social-environmental crises, governance vacuums, wetland valuation, and leadership. It also discusses collective strategies for the transformation of negative feedback loops, such as norms and regulations detrimental to wetland protection, and those related to resistance to change of wetland surface area due to unregulated urbanization. From an Urban Green Commons perspective, this work illustrates the complexity of dealing with contested nature, making it a resource difficult to govern collectively given all the different interests and values in place. It also shows that there have been successful periods of active wetland management that have influenced active democratic processes regarding land use and land use change in the city.

AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are often viewed as a way to simultaneously improve conservation outcomes and the wellbeing of rural households who receive the payments. However, evidence for such win-win outcomes has been elusive. We add to the growing literature on conservation program impacts by using primary household survey data to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of participation in Costa Rica’s PES program. Despite the substantial cash transfers to voluntary participants in this program, we do not detect any evidence of impacts on their wealth or self-reported well-being using a quasi-experimental design. These results are consistent with the common claim that voluntary PES do not harm participants, but they beg the question of why landowners participate if they do not benefit. Landowners in our sample voluntarily renewed their contracts after five years in the program and thus are unlikely to have underestimated their costs of participation. They apparently did not invest additional income from the program in farm inputs such as cattle or hired labor, since both decreased as a result of participation. Nor do we find evidence that participation encouraged moves off-farm. Instead, semi-structured interviews suggest that participants joined the program to secure their property rights and contribute to the public good of forest conservation. Thus, in order to understand the social impacts of PES, we need to look beyond simple economic rationales and material outcomes.

AB  - In central Chile, increasing demand for water and decreasing runoff volumes due to drier conditions have placed catchments in this zone under water stress. However, scarcity of observed data records increases the difficulty of planning future water supply. Instrumental records suggest a reduction in streamflow over the last 56 years. However, this change is not statistically significant and the lack of meteorological stations with long records in this mountainous region hampers a deeper analysis, motivating the use of tree rings to analyse whether these changes are part of a long-term trend. This work represents the first high-elevation runoff reconstruction in Chile using 300 years of tree ring chronologies of Araucaria araucana and Astroceudrus chilensis. The upper part of Biobío river melting season runoff (October–March) and pluvial season runoff (April–September) was reconstructed and analysed to investigate the influence of large-scale climatic drivers on runoff generation, current drought trends and to improve the understanding of climate variability in this region. We obtained positive correlations between the 20-year moving average of reconstructed pluvial season runoff and reconstructed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which is indicative of multi-decadal variability. We also found a negative correlation between the 11-year moving average of reconstructed melting season runoff and the PDO and positive correlations with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Important differences in the runoff variability of the upper and the lower part of the catchment were identified which are in part led by the influence of the large-scale climatic features that drive runoff generation in both regions. We found that the changes observed in the instrumental records are part of multi-decadal cycles led by the PDO and SAM for pluvial season runoff and melting season runoff, respectively.

AB  - Since 2010 an uninterrupted sequence of dry years, with annual rainfall deficits ranging from 25 to 45 %, has prevailed in Central Chile (western South America, 30–38° S). Although intense 1- or 2-year droughts are recurrent in this Mediterranean-like region, the ongoing event stands out because of its longevity and large spatial extent. The extraordinary character of the so-called Central Chile Mega Drought (MD) was established against century long historical records and a millennial tree-ring reconstruction of regional precipitation. The largest MD-averaged rainfall relative anomalies occurred in the northern, semi-arid sector of central Chile but the event was unprecedented to the south of 35° S. ENSO neutral conditions have prevailed since 2011 (but for the strong El Niño 2015) contrasting with La Niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts. The precipitation deficit diminished the Andean snowpack and resulted in amplified declines (up to 90 %) of river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central Chile and westernmost Argentina. In some semiarid basins we also found a conspicuous decrease in the runoff-to-rainfall coefficient. A substantial decrease in vegetation productivity occurred in the shrubland-dominated, northern sector, but a mix of greening and browning patches occurred farther south where irrigated croplands and exotic forest plantations dominate. The ongoing warming in central Chile, making the MD one of the warmest 6-year period on record, may have also contributed to such complex vegetation changes by increasing potential evapotranspiration. The understanding of the nature and biophysical impacts of the MD contributes to preparedness efforts to face a dry, warm future regional climate scenario.

AB  - This paper evaluates the relationship between fire occurrence (number and burned area) and
climate variability (precipitation and maximum temperatures) across central and south-central Chile
(32°–43° S) during recent decades (1976–2013). This region sustains the largest proportion of the Chilean
population, contains ecologically important remnants of endemic ecosystems, the largest extension of
forest exotic plantations, and concentrates most of the fire activity in the country. Fire activity in central
Chile was mainly associated with above-average precipitation during winter of the previous year and
with dry conditions during spring to summer. The later association was particularly strong in the southern,
wetter part of the study region. Maximum temperature had a positive significant relationship with
burned area across the study region, with stronger correlations toward the south. Fires in central Chile
were significantly related to El Nino~ –Southern Oscillation, through rainfall anomalies during the year
previous to the fire season. The Antarctic Oscillation during winter through summer was positively
related to fires across the study area due to drier/warmer conditions associated with the positive polarity
of this oscillation. Climate change projections for the region reveal an all-season decrease in precipitation
and increases in temperature, that may likely result in an increment of the occurrence and the area
affected by fires, as it has been observed during a multi-year drought afflicting central Chile since 2010.

AB  - Fissurella maxima is a keyhole limpet that is abundant and well preserved in archaeological shell midden sites along the coast of Chile, making it an appropriate species to use for reconstructions of past sea surface temperature (SST). In the present study we evaluate the potential of F. maxima shells as a proxy of SST by analysing δ18O of modern shells collected alive from the Atacama desert (area of Taltal, 25°S) and archaeological shells from two Early Holocene rockshelter sites: 224A and Paposo Norte 9. Reconstructed SST from modern F. maxima shells were related to SST obtained from in situ thermometers, supporting the use of this mollusc species as a paleotemperature archive. Mean SST reconstructed from Early Holocene archaeological shells (14.13 °C) was 2.86 °C cooler than mean temperature recorded in modern shells (16.99 °C). Mean SST reconstructed from modern shells was ~1.04 °C warmer than the mean temperature of in situ thermometers (15.95°C). Hence the paleo–SST data from archaeological sites 224A and Paposo Norte 9 enrich the Early Holocene nearshore paleoceanographic scenario of the Pacific coast of South America, with mean SST cooler than present-day SST. Our results validate the use of F. maxima shells as a SST proxy and contribute to a better understanding of the latitudinal distribution of the coastal upwelling regime during the Early Holocene, temporal changes in the structure of the Humboldt Current along the Holocene, and its influence on human adaptation through the prehistory of South America.

AB  - Tree-ring anatomical anomalies have received little attention in southern South American trees, however they can contain valuable intra-annual environmental information. This study addressed for the first time the three most frequent tree- ring anomalies recorded in the northern and oldest known Austrocedrus chilensis forest in central Chile (32-35°S). Three anatomic anomalies described were: partially absent rings, intra-annual bands and frost rings. Partially absent rings resulted from cambial inactivity during a complete growing period and require dendrochronological tools to be detected. Intra- annual bands are consequence of the abundance-shortage of environmental resources during the growing season and can be detected by examining the undefined late-wood boundaries. Frost rings, are caused by extreme low temperatures and are characterized by collapsed cells in the tree-ring growth. Results indicate that the northern most population exhibited the highest rate of absent rings, while the occurrence of intra-annual bands seems to be rather minor in the study area. Finally, frost rings are registered mainly in the younger trees in all three studied sites. These results suggest the potential for future spatio-temporal studies that examine the frequency of these anatomical anomalies in A. chilensis chronologies along its wide geographical distribution. This will complement the current environmental information recorded by its growth rates.

T2  - Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics
AB  - The spatial distribution of the near-surface air temperature over a coastal mountain range in southern Chile [Nahuelbuta Mountains (NM), 38°S, maximum height 1300-m ASL] is investigated using in situ measurements, satellite-derived land-surface temperature, and simulations during the austral winter of 2011. Based on a few selected but representative cases, we found that under rainy conditions—either at day or night—temperature decreases with height close to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (~6.5 °C/km). Likewise, the temperature tends to follow the dry adiabat (~9.8 °C/km) during daytime under dry- and clear-skies conditions. During clear-skies nights, the temperature also decreases with height over the southeastern side of NM, but it often increases (at about 8 °C/km) over the northwestern side of the mountains. This temperature inversion extends up to about 700-m ASL leading to an average temperature contrast of about 7 °C between the northwestern and southeastern sides of Nahuelbuta by the end of dry nights. These dawns also feature substantial temperature differences (>10 °C) among closely located stations at a same altitude. High-resolution numerical simulations suggest that upstream blocking of the prevailing SE flow, hydrostatic mountain waves, and strong downslope winds is responsible for such distinctive nocturnal temperature distribution.

AB  - Elucidating the timing and regional extent of abrupt climate events during the last glacial-interglacial transition (∼18–11.5 ka) is critical for identifying spatial patterns and mechanisms responsible for large-magnitude climate events. The record of climate change in the Southern Hemisphere during this time period, however, remains scarce and unevenly distributed. We present new geomorphic, chronological, and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) data from a climatically sensitive mountain glacier at Monte San Lorenzo (47°S), Central Patagonia. Twenty-four new cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages from moraines provide a comprehensive glacial record in the mid-latitudes of South America, which constrain the timing, spatial extent and magnitude of glacial fluctuations during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, ∼14.5–12.9 ka). Río Tranquilo glacier advanced and reached a maximum extent at 13.9 ± 0.7 ka. Three additional inboard moraines afford statistically similar ages, indicating repeated glacier expansions or marginal fluctuations over the ACR. Our record represents the northernmost robust evidence of glacial fluctuations during the ACR in southern South America, documenting not only the timing of the ACR maximum, but also the sequence of glacier changes within this climate event. Based on ELA reconstructions, we estimate a cooling of >1.6–1.8 °C at the peak of the ACR. The Río Tranquilo record along with existing glacial reconstructions from New Zealand (43°S) and paleovegetation records from northwestern (41°S) and central-west (45°S) Patagonia, suggest an uniform trans-Pacific glacier-climate response to an ACR trigger across the southern mid-latitudes. We posit that the equatorial migration of the southern westerly winds provides an adequate mechanism to propagate a common ACR signal across the Southern Hemisphere.

AB  - Equivalent black carbon () mass concentrations in the fine inhalable fraction of airborne particles () were determined using a 7-wavelength Aethalometer for 17 months, between November 2014 and March 2016, for a suburban location of the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (MABA), Argentina. In addition to describing seasonal and diurnal black carbon (BC) cycles for the first time in this region, the relative contributions of fossil fuel and remote and local biomass burning were determined by distinguishing different carbonaceous components based on their effect on light attenuation for different wavelengths. Trajectory analyses and satellite-based fire products were used to illustrate the impact of long-range transport of particles emitted by non-local sources. EBC data showed a marked diurnal cycle, largely modulated by traffic variations and the height of the boundary layer, and a seasonal cycle with monthly median EBC concentrations (in ) ranging from 1.5 (February) to 3.4 (June). Maximum values were found during winter due to the combination of prevailingly stable atmospheric conditions and the increase of fossil fuel emissions, derived primarily from traffic and biomass burning from the domestic use of wood for heating. The use of charcoal grills was also detected and concentrated during weekends. The average contribution of fossil fuel combustion sources to concentrations was 96%, with the remaining 4% corresponding to local and regional biomass burning. During the entire study period, only two events were identified during which concentrations attributed to regional biomass burning accounted for over 50% of total ; these events demonstrate the relevance of agricultural and forestry activities that take place far from the city yet whose emissions can affect the urban atmosphere of the MABA.

AB  - Due to recent atmospheric and oceanic warming, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most challenging regions of Antarctica to understand in terms of both local- and regional-scale climate signals. Steep topography and a lack of long-term and in situ meteorological observations complicate the extrapolation of existing climate models to the sub-regional scale. Therefore, new techniques must be developed to better understand processes operating in the region. Isotope signals are traditionally related mainly to atmospheric conditions, but a detailed analysis of individual components can give new insight into oceanic and atmospheric processes. This paper aims to use new isotopic records collected from snow and firn cores in conjunction with existing meteorological and oceanic datasets to determine changes at the climatic scale in the northern extent of the Antarctic Peninsula. In particular, a discernible effect of sea ice cover on local temperatures and the expression of climatic modes, especially the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), is demonstrated. In years with a large sea ice extension in winter (negative SAM anomaly), an inversion layer in the lower troposphere develops at the coastal zone. Therefore, an isotope–temperature relationship (δ–T) valid for all periods cannot be obtained, and instead the δ–T depends on the seasonal variability of oceanic conditions. Comparatively, transitional seasons (autumn and spring) have a consistent isotope–temperature gradient of +0.69 ‰ °C−1. As shown by firn core analysis, the near-surface temperature in the northern-most portion of the Antarctic Peninsula shows a decreasing trend (−0.33 °C year−1) between 2008 and 2014. In addition, the deuterium excess (dexcess) is demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of seasonal oceanic conditions, and therefore suitable to improve a firn age model based on seasonal dexcess variability. The annual accumulation rate in this region is highly variable, ranging between 1060 and 2470 kg m−2 year−1 from 2008 to 2014. The combination of isotopic and meteorological data in areas where data exist is key to reconstruct climatic conditions with a high temporal resolution in polar regions where no direct observations exist.

AB  - We present the evolution of the atmospheric variables that affect planetary climate by increasing the obliquity by using a general circulation model (PlaSim) coupled to a slab ocean with mixed layer flux correction.

We increase the obliquity between 30° and 90° in 16 aquaplanets with liquid sea surface and perform the simulation allowing the sea ice cover formation to be a consequence of its atmospheric dynamics.

Insolation is maintained constant in each experiment, but changing the obliquity affects the radiation budget and the large scale circulation. Earth-like atmospheric dynamics is observed for planets with obliquity under 54°. Above this value, the latitudinal temperature gradient is reversed giving place to a new regime of jet streams, affecting the shape of Hadley and Ferrel cells and changing the position of the InterTropical Convergence Zone.

As humidity and high temperatures determine Earth’s habitability, we introduce the wet bulb temperature as an atmospheric index of habitability for Earth-like aquaplanets with above freezing temperatures. The aquaplanets are habitable all year round at all latitudes for values under 54°; above this value habitability decreases toward the poles due to high temperatures.

AB  - The coastal wetland of El Yali (33.82-33.72° S) is a priority site for the conservation of the flora and fauna of central Chile. In fact, it has been declared the Ramsar wetland and National Reserve by the Chilean authorities. In this chapter, a synopsis on the natural history and ecological patterns of the wetland is presented. Therefore, this effort aims to provide tools and implements that cover all the elements necessary to build up a conservation vision for the wetlands in Chile. Our background compilation demonstrates that the El Yali flora and fauna exhibit extraordinary biogeographic singularities and conservation states. However, our knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms that determine the functioning and structure of their biological communities is limited, especially for fauna. The scarcity of information is critical considering that since pre-hispanic times, the anthropic pressures on the El Yali wetland ecosystems have been particularly strong. For this reason, a series of recommendations and future projections are proposed, all of which seek to improve and suggest new lines of action when it comes to the preservation and sustainable development of the coastal wetland.

Traditional reconstruction for SPECT is done by finding the radiation source, nevertheless the attenuation of the surrounding tissue affects the data. In this context, ballistic and first scattering information are used to recover source and attenuation simultaneously. Both measurements are related with the Attenuated Radon Transform and a Klein-Nishina angular type dependency is considered for the scattering. The proposed ART algorithm allow us to obtain good reconstructions of both objects in a few number of iterations.

TI  - A human-scale perspective on global warming: Zero emission year and personal quotes
AU  - de la Fuente, A.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - This article builds on the premise that human consumption of goods, food and transport are the ultimate drivers of climate change. However, the nature of the climate change problem (well described as a tragedy of the commons) makes it difficult for individuals to recognise their personal duty to implement behavioural changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, this article aims to analyse the climate change issue from a human-scale perspective, in which each of us has a clearly defined personal quota of CO2 emissions that limits our activity and there is a finite time during which CO2  emissions must be eliminated to achieve the “well below 2 °C” warming limit set by the Paris Agreement of 2015 (COP21). Thus, this work’s primary contribution is to connect an  equal per capita fairness approach to a global carbon budget, linking personal levels with planetary levels. Here, we show that a personal quota of 5.0 tons of CO 2 yr -1 p -1 is a representative value for both past and future emissions; for this level of a constant per capita emissions and without considering any mitigation, the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2030 and 2050, respectively. These are references years that provide an order of magnitude of the time that is left to reverse the global warming trend. More realistic scenarios that consider a smooth transition toward a zero-emission world show that the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2040 and 2080, respectively. Implications of this paper include a return to personal responsibility following equity principles among individuals, and a definition of boundaries to the personal emissions of CO2 .

AB  - Mineral dust is the major continental contributor to the global atmospheric aerosol burden with important effects on the climate system. Regionally, a large fraction of the emitted dust is produced in North Africa, however the total emission flux from this region is still highly uncertain. In order to reduce these uncertainties, emission estimates through top-down approaches (i.e., usually models constrained by observations) had been successfully developed and implemented. Such studies usually rely on a single observational dataset and propagate the possible observational errors of this dataset onto the emission estimates. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five different satellites are assimilated one by one in a source inversion system to estimate dust emission fluxes over northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We estimate mineral dust emissions for the year 2006 and discuss the impact of the assimilated dataset on the analysis. We find a relatively large dispersion in flux estimates among the five experiments, which can likely be attributed to differences in the assimilated observation datasets and their associated error statistics. We also show how the assimilation of a variety of AOD products can help to identify systematic errors in models.

AB  - The knowledge of surface ozone mole fractions and their global distribution is of utmost importance due to the impact of ozone on human health and ecosystems and the central role of ozone in controlling the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. The availability of long-term ozone records is far better in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, and recent analyses of the seven accessible records in the Southern Hemisphere have shown inconclusive trends. Since late 1995, surface ozone is measured in situ at "El Tololo", a high-altitude (2200 m a.s.l.) and pristine station in Chile (30° S, 71° W). The dataset has been recently fully quality controlled and reprocessed. This study presents the observed ozone trends and annual cycles and identifies key processes driving these patterns. From 1995 to 2010, an overall positive trend of  ∼  0.7 ppb decade−1 is found. Strongest trends per season are observed in March and April. Highest mole fractions are observed in late spring (October) and show a strong correlation with ozone transported from the stratosphere down into the troposphere, as simulated with a model. Over the 20 years of observations, the springtime ozone maximum has shifted to earlier times in the year, which, again, is strongly correlated with a temporal shift in the occurrence of the maximum of simulated stratospheric ozone transport at the site. We conclude that background ozone at El Tololo is mainly driven by stratospheric intrusions rather than photochemical production from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. The major footprint of the sampled air masses is located over the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, due to the negligible influence of local processes, the ozone record also allows studying the influence of El Niño and La Niña episodes on background ozone levels in South America. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, during La Niña conditions, ozone mole fractions reach higher levels than during El Niño conditions.

AB  - In the Mediterranean Andes (MA; 30°S–37°S), the main rivers are largely fed by melting snowpack and provide fresh water to around 10 million people on both sides of the Cordillera. Water resources in the MA are under pressure due to the extensive development of industrial agriculture and mining activities. This pressure is increasing as the region faces one of its worst recorded droughts. Previous studies have pointed to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the main climatic force impacting the MA. However, the role of decadal and multidecadal climate variability, their spatial patterns and the recurrence of long-term droughts, remains poorly studied. In this contribution to a better understanding of these factors, spatial and temporal patterns of hydroclimatic variability are analyzed using an extensive database of streamflow, precipitation, and snowpack covering the period between 1910 – 2011. These analyses are based on the combination of correlation, principal components and kernel-estimation techniques. Despite a general common pattern across the MA region, our results identify two hydroclimatic sub-regions, located north and south of 34°S. While the interannual variability associated with ENSO is slightly stronger north of 34°S, the variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and/or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation index (IPO) shows similar patterns in both regions. However, variations produced by the IPO forcing seem to be greater in the southern sub-region since 1975. Our estimations on drought recurrence reveal a generalized increase in dry extremes since the 1950’s. These findings suggest that the northern MA are more vulnerable to changes in hydrology and climate than the southern MA.

AB  - Thermal energy storage systems (TES) are a key component of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants that generally use a NaNO3/KNO3 mixture also known as solar salt as a thermal storage material. Improvements in TES materials are important to lower CSP costs, increase energy efficiency and competitiveness with other technologies. A novel alternative examined in this paper is the use of salt mixtures with lithium nitrate that help to reduce the salt’s melting point and improve thermal capacity. This in turn allows the volume of materials required to be reduced. Based on data for commercial plants and the expected evolution of the lithium market, the technical and economic prospects for this alternative are evaluated considering recent developments of Lithium Nitrates and the uncertain future prices of lithium. Through a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis it is concluded that some of the mixtures could allow a reduction in the costs of CSP plants, improving their competitiveness.

AB  - Este artículo presenta un análisis de discurso a cuatro medios de prensa digital en Chile respecto a la mitigación y la adaptación al cambio climático. La investigación, sin precedentes para el caso chileno, se orienta a conocer los encuadres noticiosos con que es comunicado el cambio climático, ya que los medios son la principal fuente de información del cambio climático para los tomadores de decisión y la ciudadanía. Los resultados muestran que los definidores primarios del tema son los actores gubernamentales de nivel nacional, y la invisibilización de las personas y organizaciones ciudadanas en el proceso. Vemos así un alto grado de consenso entre los actores visibilizados respecto al encuadre  de oportunidad económica, y la ausencia de encuadres de ecología crítica. Las conclusiones apuntan a que este desbalance podría influir en un diseño de políticas públicas con un sesgo tecnocrático, perdiendo la posibilidad de construir una visión integral del desarrollo del país.

AB  - Global warming is expected to enhance radial tree growth at alpine treeline sites worldwide. We developed a well-replicated tree-ring chronology from Nothofagus pumilio near treeline in a high precipitation climate on Choshuenco Volcano (40°S) in Chile to examine: (a) variation in tree radial growth in relation to interannual climatic variability; and (b) relationships of radial growth to variability in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) at interannual and decadal time scales. A tree-ring chronology based on 99 tree-ring series from 80 N. pumilio trees near treeline showed a high series intercorrelation (0.48) indicating a strong common environmental signal. Radial growth is negatively correlated with precipitation in late spring (November–December). Temperature and tree growth are positively correlated during late spring and early summer (November–January). Interannual variability in both seasonal climate and in tree growth is strongly teleconnected to ENSO and AAO variability. Radial growth of N. pumilio in this humid high-elevation forest does not show a positive trend over the past half century as predicted from global treeline theory and broadscale warming in the Patagonian-Andean region. Instead, tree growth increased sharply from the 1960s to a peak in the early 1980s but subsequently declined for c. 30years to its lowest level in >100years. The shift to higher radial growth after c. 1976 coincides with a shift towards warmer sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific which in turn are associated with warmer growing season temperatures. The decline in tree growth since the mid-1990s is coincident with the increasingly positive phase of the AAO and high spring precipitation periods associated with El Niño conditions. The recent shift towards reduced growth of N. pumilio at this humid high-elevation site coincident with rising AAO mirrors the reduced tree growth beginning in the 1960s for trees growing in relatively xeric, lower elevation sites throughout the Patagonian-Andean region. The current study indicates that N. pumilio growth response in humid high-elevation environments to recent broad-scale warming has been non-linear, and that AAO and ENSO are key climatic forcings of tree growth variability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chile has recently been reclassified by the World Bank from an upper-middle-income country to a high-income country. There has been great progress in the last 20 to 30 years in relation to air and water pollution in Chile. Yet after 25 years of unrestrained growth, there remain clear challenges posed by air and water pollution, as well as climate change. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review environmental health in Chile. METHODS: In late 2013, a 3-day workshop on environmental health was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together researchers and government policymakers. As a follow-up to that workshop, here we review the progress made in environmental health in the past 20 to 30 years and discuss the challenges of the future. We focus on air and water pollution and climate change, which we believe are among the most important areas of environmental health in Chile. RESULTS: Air pollution in some cities remains among the highest in the continent. Potable water is generally available, but weak state supervision has led to serious outbreaks of infectious disease and ongoing issues with arsenic exposure in some regions. Climate change modeling in Chile is quite sophisticated, and a number of the impacts of climate change can be reasonably predicted in terms of which areas of the country are most likely to be affected by increased temperature and decreased availability of water, as well as expansion of vector territory. Some health effects, including changes in vector-borne diseases and excess heat mortality, can be predicted. However, there has yet to be an integration of such research with government planning. CONCLUSIONS: Although great progress has been made, currently there are a number of problems. We suspect that the Chilean experience in environmental health may be of some use for other Latin American countries with rapid economic development.

AB  - The response of the tropical climate in the Indian Ocean realm to abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic Ocean is contentious. Repositioning of the intertropical convergence zone is thought to have been responsible for changes in tropical hydroclimate during North Atlantic cold spells, but the dearth of high-resolution records outside the monsoon realm in the Indian Ocean precludes a full understanding of this remote relationship and its underlying mechanisms. Here we show that slowdowns of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas stadial affected the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate through changes to the Hadley circulation including a southward shift in the rising branch (the intertropical convergence zone) and an overall weakening over the southern Indian Ocean. Our results are based on new, high-resolution sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope records of well-dated sedimentary archives from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for the past 45,000 years, combined with climate model simulations of Atlantic circulation slowdown under Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 boundary conditions. Similar conditions in the east and west of the basin rule out a zonal dipole structure as the dominant forcing of the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate of millennial-scale events. Results from our simulations and proxy data suggest dry conditions in the northern Indian Ocean realm and wet and warm conditions in the southern realm during North Atlantic cold spells.

AB  - Urban pollution can often impact surrounding, non-urban regions, through advection and dispersal of pollutants by the prevailing winds. Urban regions located upstream of high mountains, such as the Andes, can potentially impact the cryosphere by deposition of particles onto the surface of the snowpack and glaciers.
    Santiago, the capital of Chile, has more than 6 million inhabitants and regularly experiences episodes of severe pollution, particularly during the austral winter. Some studies have hypothesized that particle pollution from Santiago can reach the cryosphere downwind of the city, but the scarcity of measurements made high in the mountains prevents the validation of mesoscale models so the proof of actual impact remains elusive. A research project was designed to provide some insight into this question. The Pollution Impact on Snow in the Cordillera - Experiments and Simulations (PISCES) project was carried out in 2014 and includes both observational and modeling components. A five-week field campaign was conducted at the end of winter, at an elevated site in a mountain valley, 65 km to the southeast of the center of Santiago, to characterize some aspects of particulate pollution.
    During synoptic conditions that result in clear days at the site, the mesoscale mountain-valley circulation is effective in transporting pollutants upwards during the day, leading to diluted particle concentrations beyond the summits of the highest peaks. Cloudy days with reduced up-valley circulation do not show increased concentrations associated with transport. Back trajectories indicate that airmasses reaching the site during the field campaign are seldom influenced by pollution from Santiago.

TI  - Warm Winter Storms in Central Chile
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
AB  - Central Chile is a densely populated region along the west coast of subtropical SouthAmerica (30°-36°S), limited to the east by the Andes. Precipitation is concentrated in austral winter, mostly associated with the passage of cold fronts. The freezing level over central Chile is typically between 1500 and 2500m when precipitation is present. In about a third of the cases, however, precipitation occurs accompanied by warm temperatures and freezing levels above 3000 m, leading to a sizeable increment in the pluvial area of Andean basins and setting the stage for hydrometeorological hazards. Here, warm winter storms in central Chile are studied, including a statistical description of their occurrence and an estimate of their hydrological impacts. Remote-sensed data and high-resolution reanalysis are used to explore the synoptic-scale environment of a typical case, generalized later by a compositing analysis. The structure of warm storms is also contrasted with that of the more recurrent cold cases. Precipitation during warm events occurs in the warm sector of a slow-moving cold front because of the intense moisture flux against the mountains in connection with a land-falling atmospheric river. This is in turn driven by a strong zonal jet aloft and reduced mechanical blocking upstream of the Andes. On a broader scale, a key element is the presence of a slowly moving anticyclone over the south Pacific, fostering advection of cold air intomidlatitudes. The intense and persistent zonal jet stretches a moist-air corridor from the central Pacific to the west coast of South America. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Despite evidence from a number of Earth systems that abrupt temporal changes known as regime shifts are important, their nature, scale and mechanisms remain poorly documented and understood. Applying principal component analysis, change-point analysis and a sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts to 72 time series, we confirm that the 1980s regime shift represented a major change in the Earth's biophysical systems from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and occurred at slightly different times around the world. Using historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and statistical modelling of historical temperatures, we then demonstrate that this event was triggered by rapid global warming from anthropogenic plus natural forcing, the latter associated with the recovery from the El Chichón volcanic eruption. The shift in temperature that occurred at this time is hypothesized as the main forcing for a cascade of abrupt environmental changes. Within the context of the last century or more, the 1980s event was unique in terms of its global scope and scale; our observed consequences imply that if unavoidable natural events such as major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming unforeseen multiplier effects may occur.

AB  - Pleistocene glaciations produced significant increases in continental ice cover in polar and mid-latitude temperate areas, sea-level declines and shifts and reshuffling of biomes, all of which promote either isolation, coalescence or fragmentation in the distribution of land biota. If populations of several taxa have been co-distributed for a prolonged time, and if the periods between perturbation or vicariance processes have been more or less stable, it is expected that divergence patterns of closely related and ecologically similar species will be congruent because of their similar biological and demographic characteristics. Based on this premise, we analysed the phylogeographic structure (cytochrome b) of Liolaemus pictus and Batrachyla leptopus, two widely co-distributed lizard and frog species, respectively, in the Chiloé Archipelago of southern Chile, to decipher their genetic structure in response to a common climatic and environmental history. Haplotype network analysis and Bayesian inference suggest an evolutionary pattern of genetic diversity for the two species that is consistent with the Quaternary glacial history of southern Chile, and suggests a complex phylogeographic history in the Liolaemus and Batrachyla species. High-divergence levels among haplotypes in some island populations of the archipelago also suggest genetic connectivity between putative refuges from Chiloé Island and the mainland along the exposed continental shelf during sea level minima associated with the most recent Quaternary glaciations. Our results are consistent with our hypothesis that two species have responded to parallel historical events in which the historical process during the last glacial maximum (approximately 41°S) has been sufficient to influence their phylogeographic structure.

AB  - The Rim Fire of 2013, the third largest area burned by fire recorded in California history, is simulated by a climate model coupled with a size-resolved aerosol model. Modeled aerosol mass, number, and particle size distribution are within variability of data obtained from multiple-airborne in situ measurements. Simulations suggest that Rim Fire smoke may block 4–6% of sunlight energy reaching the surface, with a dimming efficiency around 120–150 W m−2 per unit aerosol optical depth in the midvisible at 13:00–15:00 local time. Underestimation of simulated smoke single scattering albedo at midvisible by 0.04 suggests that the model overestimates either the particle size or the absorption due to black carbon. This study shows that exceptional events like the 2013 Rim Fire can be simulated by a climate model with 1° resolution with overall good skill, although that resolution is still not sufficient to resolve the smoke peak near the source region.

T2  - Research in Transportation Economics
AB  - The introduction in 2007 of a new public transport system in Santiago, Chile, brought to us an unexpected gift: the availability of Big Data; massive amounts of passive data obtained from technological devices installed to control the operation of buses and to administer the fare collection process. Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97% penetration rate.
We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning.

AB  - Promoting effective responses to climate change, especially among people who reject its anthropogenic causes, has been challenging. Following a qualitative study, we experimentally induce one of four frames of reference (identity, biodiversity conservation, economic prosperity, and climate change), and assess their effects on participants’ behavioral intentions using three scales (consumption-investment, consumption-reduction, and political participation). The sample (N = 156) included people who thought climate change is natural and those who thought it is human-induced. Results show a significant impact of the identity frame, relative to the climate-change frame, for both consumption scales, in the total sample, and among those who reject the anthropogenic causes. These results offer a way to address behavioral resistances associated with antagonistic views on climate change.

AB  - AbstractFrom a theoretical approach based on political ecology and environmental justice, we assess how forestry development has generated socio-spatial dynamics of environmental degradation and water scarcity in southern Chile. Through historical-geographical and ethnographic methods, we discuss how and why the spread of forestry plantations has significantly influenced social and environmental degradation of the Mapuche's modes of living. In response, during recent decades a political articulation of a Mapuche social movement is observed. Their demands include land, autonomy, rights and opportunities to frame their own development strategies. Within the internal diversity of this movement, a key principle is ​​reversing the spread of environmental degradation by recovering the native forest and its natural water cycles, which have been disrupted significantly by the increasing of forestry plantations. We explore these dynamics of the Mapuche movement from an environmental justice approach.Key words: Forestry monoculture; water scarcity; Mapuche; water justice; natural commons

AB  - Adaptive plasticity in foraging of early life stages of marine fishes is highly relevant, particularly in environments such as the Antarctic inshore waters. In this study we analyzed the trophic habits, feeding success and selectivity of larval spiny plunderfish Harpagifer antarcticus (Osteichthyes: Harpagiferidae) collected weekly in austral summer 2014 and 2015 at Bahía Chile, Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands. Based on the stomach contents of 202 individuals ranging between 5.97 and 10.66 mm, the spiny plunderfish was omnivorous, with chain-forming diatom Thalassiosira minuscula, euphausiid eggs and copepodites as the main prey items. The feeding success, measured as prey number per gut and total volume per gut, and the trophic niche breadth were independent of the standard length. Only the maximum prey size (width) was positively correlated with larval size, suggesting a preference for larger prey as larvae grow. At the interannual scale, significant differences were only detected in the ingested prey per gut, with higher values during summer 2014. In this season, trophic niche breadth increased with larval size. At the weekly scale, and after storm winds from southeast and high turbulence in surface waters, H. antarcticus larvae switched their selective feeding based on large prey (i.e., copepodites) to a more opportunistic feeding strategy, relying on large abundance of small (i.e., T. minuscula) to medium-size prey (euphausiid eggs). The present results suggest that larval spiny plunderfish exhibit feeding behavior plasticity, ensuring higher feeding rates after major changes triggered by meteorological conditions in a shallow embayment of the South Shetland Islands.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Most evaluations of the effectiveness of PAs have relied on indirect estimates based on comparisons between protected and unprotected areas. Such methods can be biased when protection is not randomly assigned. We add to the growing literature on the impact of PAs by answering the following research questions: What is the impact of Chilean PAs on deforestation which occurred between 1986 and 2011? How do estimates of the impact of PAs vary when using only public land as control units? We show that the characteristics of the areas in which protected and unprotected lands are located differ significantly. To satisfactorily estimate the effects of PAs, we use matching methods to define adequate control groups, but not as in previous research. We construct control groups using separately non-protected private areas and non-protected public lands. We find that PAs avoid deforestation when using unprotected private lands as valid controls, however results show no impact when the control group is based only on unprotected public land. Different land management regimes, and higher levels of enforcement inside public lands may reduce the opportunity to add additional conservation benefits when the national systems for PAs are based on the protection of previously unprotected public lands. Given that not all PAs are established to avoid deforestation, results also admit the potential for future studies to include other outcomes including forest degradation (not just deforestation), biodiversity, wildlife, primary forests (not forests in general), among others.

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - For many decades, protected areas (PAs) have been considered by decision makers and conservation practitioners as one of the most common policies to promote biodiversity conservation. Diverse studies have assessed the impact of conservation policies at global and regional levels by comparing deforestation rates between PAs and unprotected areas. Most of these studies are based on conventional methods and could overestimate the avoided deforestation of PAs by omitting from their analyses the lack of randomness in the allocation of forest protection.

We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable and testing the sensitivity of estimates of potential hidden biases. We used matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Ecuador's tropical Andean forest protected-area system between 1990 and 2008. We found that protection reduced deforestation in approximately 6% of the protected forests. These would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to estimate conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that this research will help decision-making in the framework of international climate change mitigation policies, such as REDD+.

AB  - Lakes are a nitrous oxide (N2O) source to the atmosphere, but the biogeochemical controls and microbial pathways of N2O production are not well understood. To trace microbial N2O production (denitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification) and consumption (denitrification) in two basins of Lake Lugano, we measured the concentrations and N and O isotope compositions of N2O, as well as the intramolecular 15N distribution, i.e., site preference (SP). Our results revealed differential N2O dynamics in the two lake basins, with N2O concentrations between 12 nmol L−1 and > 900 nmol L−1 in the holomictic South Basin, and significantly lower concentrations in the meromictic North Basin (<13 nmol L−1). In the South Basin, the isotope signatures reflected a complex combination of N2O production by nitrifying bacteria through hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation, N2O production through incomplete denitrification, and N2O reduction to N2, all occurring in close vicinity within the redox transition zone (RTZ). In the North Basin, in contrast, the N2O isotopomer signatures suggested that nitrifier denitrification was the main N2O source. The pronounced decrease in N2O concentrations to undetectable levels within the RTZ, in tandem with an increase in δ15N-N2O, δ18O-N2O, and SP indicated quantitative N2O consumption by microbial denitrification. In the northern basin this was primarily sulfide-dependent. The apparent N and O isotope enrichment factors associated with net N2O consumption were 15ε ≈ 3.2‰ and 18ε ≈ 8.6‰, respectively. The according 18O to 15N enrichment ratio (18ε: 15ε ≈ 2.5) is consistent with previous reports for microbial N2O reduction, underscoring its robust nature across environments.

AB  - Shell fishhooks have been found in several sites along the Pacific Coast of the Americas, but little is known about prehistoric workshops of these tools and the socio-economic context of their production and distribution. The present study provides new data about the production of mussel (Choromytilus chorus) shell fishing tools (MSFT) at Morro Colorado and Zapatero, two Middle Holocene sites on the coast of Taltal, northern Chile. The MSFT assemblages of the two sites suggest the existence of workshop areas and a specialized manufacture of C. chorus fishhooks associated with an increased dependence on fishing in local subsistence practices. Abundance and type of mussel shell fishing artifacts, preforms, and shell debris at these two shell midden sites are discussed to better understand Prehispanic workshops, the techniques used to work C. chorus shells, and the possible relationship between raw material acquisition, technological change and overall transformations in subsistence practices and levels of social complexity among Middle Holocene coastal groups along the northern coast of Chile.

AB  - We examine hydroclimate changes at centennial/millennial timescales since 16,000 yr BP in northwestern Patagonia based on the pollen and charcoal record from Lago El Salto, a small closed-basin lake located in the Chilean Lake District (41°38′48.02″S, 73° 5′48.42″W). We observe cold/wet conditions between 14,500–16,000 yr BP, followed by further cooling with increased precipitation until 13,000 yr BP, enhanced precipitation seasonality and/or variability between 11,600–13,000 yr BP, and an extended warm-and-dry interval between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP with peak paleofire activity. Colder-and-wetter than present conditions and muted paleofire activity prevail between 5300 and 7600 yr BP, followed by alternating cold/wet and centennial-scale warm/dry phases starting at 5300 yr BP with three conspicuous megadroughts since 2500 yr BP. The most recent megadrought occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly.

We identify a cold reversal that spans the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Younger Dryas (YD) chrons with stronger-than-present westerly influence during the former and enhanced variability during the latter. These results extend the northern limit of strong cooling and increase in precipitation during the ACR and the southern limit of influence of strong hydrologic variations during the YD in terrestrial environments, suggesting an overlap in the spheres of influence of processes originating from southern and northern polar latitudes. An extended warm southern westerly wind (SWW)-minimum interval is evident between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP, followed by a rapid shift to cool-moist conditions between 5300 and 7600 yr BP brought by a mid-Holocene SWW maximum. Since then we observe centennial-scale hydroclimate variability, which has driven biodiversity and fire-regime shifts of evergreen temperate rainforests.

AB  - We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system to study the impacts of biomass burning smoke from Central America on several tornado outbreaks occurring in the U.S. during spring. The model is configured with an aerosol-aware microphysics parameterization capable of resolving aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in a cost-efficient way for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. Primary aerosol emissions are included, and smoke emissions are constrained using an inverse modeling technique and satellite-based aerosol optical depth observations. Simulations turning on and off fire emissions reveal smoke presence in all tornado outbreaks being studied and show an increase in aerosol number concentrations due to smoke. However, the likelihood of occurrence and intensification of tornadoes is higher due to smoke only in cases where cloud droplet number concentration in low-level clouds increases considerably in a way that modifies the environmental conditions where the tornadoes are formed (shallower cloud bases and higher low-level wind shear). Smoke absorption and vertical extent also play a role, with smoke absorption at cloud-level tending to burn-off clouds and smoke absorption above clouds resulting in an increased capping inversion. Comparing these and WRF-Chem simulations configured with a more complex representation of aerosol size and composition and different optical properties, microphysics, and activation schemes, we find similarities in terms of the simulated aerosol optical depths and aerosol impacts on near-storm environments. This provides reliability on the aerosol-aware microphysics scheme as a less computationally expensive alternative to WRF-Chem for its use in applications such as NWP and cloud-resolving simulations.

AB  - A validation of four satellite daily precipitation estimates at a spatial resolution of 0.25° is performed over the subtropical Andes, an area of highly complex topography: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, 3B42 V7 and RT), the Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) and the Hydro-Estimator (HYDRO). Remote mountainous regions represent a major challenge for these satellite data products and for studies examining their quality with surface data.
For the assessment of the satellite products, a period of seven years from January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2010 was considered. Different statistics were analyzed considering their variability in the study area and identifying their main differences between the warm and cold seasons. The results indicate a decrease in winter errors which coincides with the wet season over the windward side of the Andes. Also, a significant underestimation of precipitation is observed for all estimates throughout the period analyzed.
The analysis with respect to terrain height shows a greater dependence of errors with topography for all the algorithms that combine infrared and passive microwave data, HYDRO providing the most stable result. The main limitations of the estimates associated with the type of precipitating event and their location relative to the orography are assessed.
Finally, the analysis of two intense precipitation events is presented and allows the assessment of the latest advances in satellite derived estimates with the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement.

AB  - Sediment depositional patterns along the upper continental slope of the northern South China Sea (SCS) have been studied using two sediment cores (GeoB16601-6, 20°09.07′N, 116°14.38′E, 1012 m water depth and GeoB16602-4, 18°57.12′N, 113°42.64′E, 951 m water depth) recovered during RV SONNE Cruise SO-221 “INVERS”. Sediment cores were analyzed for bulk sediment element composition by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and clay mineral assemblage by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The bulk sediment element and the clay mineral compositions of the two cores suggest similar depositional patterns between 50 kyr BP and ~ 29 kyr BP, and ~ 14 kyr BP to present, but a clear difference in depositional patterns during the last glacial and deglacial (~ 29–14 kyr BP) when sea level was below − 90 m. Between ~ 29–14 kyr BP, a higher kaolinite percentage in core GeoB16602-4 in comparison to core GeoB16601-6 is interpreted to reflect a higher contribution of clay supplied by the Pearl River to core site GeoB16602-4. In contrast, core GeoB16601-6 received less Pearl River supplied clayey material during the same period. When the sea level was below − 90 m during the last glacial lowstand, the detrital fine-grained materials supplied by the Pearl River were mostly transported by coastal currents to the southwest, resulting in a higher contribution of Pearl River discharged material at site GeoB16602-4 than at site GeoB16601-6. We suggest that sea-level induced modifications of the land-ocean distribution together with changes in the palaeo-physiographic conditions, such as the proximity of the palaeo-rivers to the individual core sites might be responsible for the different sediment depositional patterns in the study area. Thus, the overriding control of sea-level induced changes on the sediment depositional environment might mask climate-related changes in sediment depositional pattern in the northern SCS.

AB  - The high-resolution CO2 record from Law Dome ice core reveals that atmospheric CO2 concentration stalled during the 1940s (so-called CO2 plateau). Since the fossil-fuel emissions did not decrease during the period, this stalling implies the persistence of a strong sink, perhaps sustained for as long as a decade or more. Double-deconvolution analyses have attributed this sink to the ocean, conceivably as a response to the very strong El Niño event in 1940-1942. However, this explanation is questionable, as recent ocean CO2 data indicate that the range of variability in the ocean sink has been rather modest in recent decades, and El Niño events have generally led to higher growth rates of atmospheric CO2 due to the offsetting terrestrial response. Here, we use the most up-to-date information on the different terms of the carbon budget: fossil-fuel emissions, four estimates of land-use change (LUC) emissions, ocean uptake from two different reconstructions, and the terrestrial sink modelled by the TRENDY project to identify the most likely causes of the 1940s plateau. We find that they greatly overestimate atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the plateau period, as well as in the 1960s, in spite of giving a plausible explanation for most of the 20th century carbon budget, especially from 1970 onwards. The mismatch between reconstructions and observations during the CO2 plateau epoch of 1940-1950 ranges between 0.9 and 2.0P-1, depending on the LUC dataset considered. This mismatch may be explained by (i) decadal variability in the ocean carbon sink not accounted for in the reconstructions we used, (ii) a further terrestrial sink currently missing in the estimates by land-surface models, or (iii) LUC processes not included in the current datasets. Ocean carbon models from CMIP5 indicate that natural variability in the ocean carbon sink could explain an additional 0.5P-1 uptake, but it is unlikely to be higher. The impact of the 1940-1942 El Niño on the observed stabilization of atmospheric CO2 cannot be confirmed nor discarded, as TRENDY models do not reproduce the expected concurrent strong decrease in terrestrial uptake. Nevertheless, this would further increase the mismatch between observed and modelled CO2 growth rate during the CO2 plateau epoch. Tests performed using the OSCAR (v2.2) model indicate that changes in land use not correctly accounted for during the period (coinciding with drastic socioeconomic changes during the Second World War) could contribute to the additional sink required. Thus, the previously proposed ocean hypothesis for the 1940s plateau cannot be confirmed by independent data. Further efforts are required to reduce uncertainty in the different terms of the carbon budget during the first half of the 20th century and to better understand the long-term variability of the ocean and terrestrial CO2 sinks. © Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the less prone environments for plant invasions, nevertheless a growing number of non-native species have been registered in the last decades with negative effects on native flora. Here we assessed adaptive phenotypic plasticity in three photoprotective traits (non-photochemical quenching, total soluble sugars, and de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls cycle), and fitness-related traits (maximum quantum yield, photosynthetic rate and total biomass) in the invasive species Poa annua and Deschampsia antarctica under current conditions of water availability and those projected by climate change models. In addition, two manipulative experiments in controlled and field conditions were conducted to evaluate the competitive ability and survival of both species under current and climate change conditions. Moreover, we performed an experiment with different water availabilities to assess cell damage as a potential mechanism involved in the competitive ability deployed in both species. Finally, was assessed the plasticity and biomass of both species subject to factorial abiotic scenarios (water × temperature, and water × nutrients) ranging from current to climate change condition. Overall, results showed that P. annua had greater phenotypic plasticity in photoprotective strategies, higher performance, and greater competitive ability and survival than D. antarctica under current and climate change conditions. Also, cell damage, assessed by lipid peroxidation, was significantly greater in D. antarctica when grown in presence of P. annua compared when grown alone. Finally, P. annua showed a greater plasticity and biomass than D. antarctica under the factorial abiotic scenarios, being more evident under a climate change scenario (i.e., higher soil moisture). Our study suggests that the high adaptive plasticity and competitive ability deployed by P. annua under current and climate change conditions allows it to cope with harsh abiotic conditions and could help explain its successful invasion in the Antarctica.

AB  - A multistructural object-based LiDAR approach to predict plant richness in complex structure forests is presented. A normalized LiDAR point cloud was split into four height ranges: 1) high canopies (points above 16 m); 2) middle-high canopies (8-16 m); 3) middle-low canopies (2-8 m); and 4) low canopies (0-2 m). A digital canopy model (DCM) was obtained from the full normalized LiDAR point cloud, and four pseudo-DCMs (pDCMs) were obtained from the split point clouds. We applied a multiresolution segmentation algorithm to the DCM and the four pDCMs to obtain crown objects. A partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) algorithm was applied to predict total vascular plant richness using object-based image analysis (OBIA) variables, derived from the delineated crown objects, and topographic variables, derived from a digital terrain model. Results showed that the object-based model was able to predict the total richness with an r2 of 0.64 and a root-mean-square error of four species. Topographic variables showed to be more important than the OBIA variables to predict richness. Furthermore, high-medium canopies (8-16 m) showed the biggest correlation with the total plant richness within the structural segments of the forest.

AB  - The interferometry problem addresses the estimation of an unknown quantity exploiting the interference among measurements from different sources. These measurements are obtained from the Fourier domain but are sparse and contaminated with noise. We propose a parametric, sum-of-basis, model for these observations together with a Bayesian approach for reconstructing interferometry images. Our main contributions are the construction of a model with a complex-valued noise source, an implementation of an approximate inference method to train the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo and a quantitative comparison against the so-called dirty algorithm, where the proposed approach outperformed the considered baseline.

AU  - Cuenca, Pablo

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - For many decades, protected areas (PAs) have been considered by decision makers and conservation practitioners as one of the most common policies to promote biodiversity conservation. Diverse studies have assessed the impact of conservation policies at global and regional levels by comparing deforestation rates between PAs and unprotected areas. Most of these studies are based on conventional methods and could overestimate the avoided deforestation of PAs by omitting from their analyses the lack of randomness in the allocation of forest protection.

We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable and testing the sensitivity of estimates of potential hidden biases. We used matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Ecuador's tropical Andean forest protected-area system between 1990 and 2008. We found that protection reduced deforestation in approximately 6% of the protected forests. These would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to estimate conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that this research will help decision-making in the framework of international climate change mitigation policies, such as REDD+.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the less prone environments for plant invasions, nevertheless a growing number of non-native species have been registered in the last decades with negative effects on native flora. Here we assessed adaptive phenotypic plasticity in three photoprotective traits (non-photochemical quenching, total soluble sugars, and de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls cycle), and fitness-related traits (maximum quantum yield, photosynthetic rate and total biomass) in the invasive species Poa annua and Deschampsia antarctica under current conditions of water availability and those projected by climate change models. In addition, two manipulative experiments in controlled and field conditions were conducted to evaluate the competitive ability and survival of both species under current and climate change conditions. Moreover, we performed an experiment with different water availabilities to assess cell damage as a potential mechanism involved in the competitive ability deployed in both species. Finally, was assessed the plasticity and biomass of both species subject to factorial abiotic scenarios (water × temperature, and water × nutrients) ranging from current to climate change condition. Overall, results showed that P. annua had greater phenotypic plasticity in photoprotective strategies, higher performance, and greater competitive ability and survival than D. antarctica under current and climate change conditions. Also, cell damage, assessed by lipid peroxidation, was significantly greater in D. antarctica when grown in presence of P. annua compared when grown alone. Finally, P. annua showed a greater plasticity and biomass than D. antarctica under the factorial abiotic scenarios, being more evident under a climate change scenario (i.e., higher soil moisture). Our study suggests that the high adaptive plasticity and competitive ability deployed by P. annua under current and climate change conditions allows it to cope with harsh abiotic conditions and could help explain its successful invasion in the Antarctica.

AB  - Global warming is expected to enhance radial tree growth at alpine treeline sites worldwide. We developed a well-replicated tree-ring chronology from Nothofagus pumilio near treeline in a high precipitation climate on Choshuenco Volcano (40°S) in Chile to examine: (a) variation in tree radial growth in relation to interannual climatic variability; and (b) relationships of radial growth to variability in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) at interannual and decadal time scales. A tree-ring chronology based on 99 tree-ring series from 80 N. pumilio trees near treeline showed a high series intercorrelation (0.48) indicating a strong common environmental signal. Radial growth is negatively correlated with precipitation in late spring (November–December). Temperature and tree growth are positively correlated during late spring and early summer (November–January). Interannual variability in both seasonal climate and in tree growth is strongly teleconnected to ENSO and AAO variability. Radial growth of N. pumilio in this humid high-elevation forest does not show a positive trend over the past half century as predicted from global treeline theory and broadscale warming in the Patagonian-Andean region. Instead, tree growth increased sharply from the 1960s to a peak in the early 1980s but subsequently declined for c. 30years to its lowest level in >100years. The shift to higher radial growth after c. 1976 coincides with a shift towards warmer sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific which in turn are associated with warmer growing season temperatures. The decline in tree growth since the mid-1990s is coincident with the increasingly positive phase of the AAO and high spring precipitation periods associated with El Niño conditions. The recent shift towards reduced growth of N. pumilio at this humid high-elevation site coincident with rising AAO mirrors the reduced tree growth beginning in the 1960s for trees growing in relatively xeric, lower elevation sites throughout the Patagonian-Andean region. The current study indicates that N. pumilio growth response in humid high-elevation environments to recent broad-scale warming has been non-linear, and that AAO and ENSO are key climatic forcings of tree growth variability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chile has recently been reclassified by the World Bank from an upper-middle-income country to a high-income country. There has been great progress in the last 20 to 30 years in relation to air and water pollution in Chile. Yet after 25 years of unrestrained growth, there remain clear challenges posed by air and water pollution, as well as climate change. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review environmental health in Chile. METHODS: In late 2013, a 3-day workshop on environmental health was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together researchers and government policymakers. As a follow-up to that workshop, here we review the progress made in environmental health in the past 20 to 30 years and discuss the challenges of the future. We focus on air and water pollution and climate change, which we believe are among the most important areas of environmental health in Chile. RESULTS: Air pollution in some cities remains among the highest in the continent. Potable water is generally available, but weak state supervision has led to serious outbreaks of infectious disease and ongoing issues with arsenic exposure in some regions. Climate change modeling in Chile is quite sophisticated, and a number of the impacts of climate change can be reasonably predicted in terms of which areas of the country are most likely to be affected by increased temperature and decreased availability of water, as well as expansion of vector territory. Some health effects, including changes in vector-borne diseases and excess heat mortality, can be predicted. However, there has yet to be an integration of such research with government planning. CONCLUSIONS: Although great progress has been made, currently there are a number of problems. We suspect that the Chilean experience in environmental health may be of some use for other Latin American countries with rapid economic development.

AB  - Urban pollution can often impact surrounding, non-urban regions, through advection and dispersal of pollutants by the prevailing winds. Urban regions located upstream of high mountains, such as the Andes, can potentially impact the cryosphere by deposition of particles onto the surface of the snowpack and glaciers.
    Santiago, the capital of Chile, has more than 6 million inhabitants and regularly experiences episodes of severe pollution, particularly during the austral winter. Some studies have hypothesized that particle pollution from Santiago can reach the cryosphere downwind of the city, but the scarcity of measurements made high in the mountains prevents the validation of mesoscale models so the proof of actual impact remains elusive. A research project was designed to provide some insight into this question. The Pollution Impact on Snow in the Cordillera - Experiments and Simulations (PISCES) project was carried out in 2014 and includes both observational and modeling components. A five-week field campaign was conducted at the end of winter, at an elevated site in a mountain valley, 65 km to the southeast of the center of Santiago, to characterize some aspects of particulate pollution.
    During synoptic conditions that result in clear days at the site, the mesoscale mountain-valley circulation is effective in transporting pollutants upwards during the day, leading to diluted particle concentrations beyond the summits of the highest peaks. Cloudy days with reduced up-valley circulation do not show increased concentrations associated with transport. Back trajectories indicate that airmasses reaching the site during the field campaign are seldom influenced by pollution from Santiago.

AB  - Aims

Climate and human impacts are changing the nitrogen (N) inputs and losses in terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is largely unknown how these two major drivers of global change will simultaneously influence the N cycle in drylands, the largest terrestrial biome on the planet. We conducted a global observational study to evaluate how aridity and human impacts, together with biotic and abiotic factors, affect key soil variables of the N cycle.


Location

Two hundred and twenty-four dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica widely differing in their environmental conditions and human influence.


Methods

Using a standardized field survey, we measured aridity, human impacts (i.e. proxies of land uses and air pollution), key biophysical variables (i.e. soil pH and texture and total plant cover) and six important variables related to N cycling in soils: total N, organic N, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic:inorganic N and N mineralization rates. We used structural equation modelling to assess the direct and indirect effects of aridity, human impacts and key biophysical variables on the N cycle.


Results

Human impacts increased the concentration of total N, while aridity reduced it. The effects of aridity and human impacts on the N cycle were spatially disconnected, which may favour scarcity of N in the most arid areas and promote its accumulation in the least arid areas.


Main conclusions

We found that increasing aridity and anthropogenic pressure are spatially disconnected in drylands. This implies that while places with low aridity and high human impact accumulate N, most arid sites with the lowest human impacts lose N. Our analyses also provide evidence that both increasing aridity and human impacts may enhance the relative dominance of inorganic N in dryland soils, having a negative impact on key functions and services provided by these ecosystems.

AB  - The relations between humans and animals extend into socio-cultural aspects that go beyond the mere acquisition of food, meaning that animals constitute cultural resources that fulfill diverse roles in social and cultural systems. Visual images in different media, including rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract, non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete, practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here, based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca. 13,000-410. BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions. In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in the economy of local societies.

AB  - Air quality networks need revision and optimisation as instruments and network requirements, both scientific and societal, evolve over time. Assessing and optimising the information content of a monitoring network is a non-trivial problem. Here, we introduce a methodology formulated in a variational framework using an air quality model to simulate the dispersion of carbon monoxide (CO) as a passive tracer at the city scale.Weaddress the specific case of adding or removing stations, and the more general situation of optimally distributing a given number of stations in a domain taking into account transport patterns and spatial factors such as population density and emission patterns.Weconsider three quality indicators: precision gain, information gain and degrees of freedom for a signal. These metrics are all functions of the singular values of the sensitivity matrix that links emissions and observations in the variational framework.Weillustrate the application of the methodology in the case of Santiago (33.58S, 70.58W, 500ma.s.l.), a city of ca. 7 million inhabitants with significant pollution levels. Wedeem information gain as the best of the above indicators for this case.Wethen quantify the actual evolution of Santiago’s network and compare it with the optimal configuration suggested by our methodology and with results previously obtained using a statistical approach. The application is restricted to diurnal and summer conditions, for which the dispersion model shows a good agreement with observations. The current method offers advantages in that it allows extending a network to include new sites, and it explicitly considers the effects of dispersion patterns, and desired weighting functions such as emission fluxes and population density. We find that Santiago’s air quality has improved two-fold since 1988, regarding CO under diurnal summer conditions. Still, according to our results, the current configuration could be improved by integrating more suburban stations in the southwest of the basin.

AB  - Within large uncertainties in the precipitation response to greenhouse gas forcing, the Southeast Pacific drying stands out as a robust signature within climate models. A precipitation decline, of consistent direction but of larger amplitude than obtained in simulations with historical climate forcing, has been observed in central Chile since the late 1970s. To attribute the causes of this trend, we analyze local rain gauge data and contrast them to a large ensemble of both fully coupled and sea surface temperature-forced simulations. We show that in concomitance with large-scale circulation changes, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation explains about half of the precipitation trend observed in central Chile. The remaining fraction is unlikely to be driven exclusively by natural phenomena but rather consistent with the simulated regional effect of anthropogenic climate change. We particularly estimate that a quarter of the rainfall deficit affecting this region since 2010 is of anthropogenic origin. An increased persistence and recurrence of droughts in central Chile emerges then as a realistic scenario under the current socioeconomic pathway.

AB  - Cyanobacteria from Subsection V (Stigonematales) are important components of microbial mats in non-acidic terrestrial hot springs. Despite their diazotrophic nature (N2 fixers), their impact on the nitrogen cycle in such extreme ecosystems remains unknown. Here, we surveyed the identity and activity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the neutral hot spring of Porcelana (Northern Patagonia, Chile) during 2009 and 2011-2013. We used 16S rRNA and the nifH gene to analyze the distribution and diversity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the dominance of the heterocystous genus Mastigocladus (Stigonematales) along the entire temperature gradient of the hot spring (69-38 °C). In situ nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction), nitrogen fixation rates (cellular uptake of (15)N2) and nifH transcription levels in the microbial mats showed that nitrogen fixation and nifH mRNA expression were light-dependent. Nitrogen fixation activities were detected at temperatures ranging from 58 °C to 46 °C, with maximum daily rates of 600 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) per day and 94.1 nmol N cm(-2) per day. These activity patterns strongly suggest a heterocystous cyanobacterial origin and reveal a correlation between nitrogenase activity and nifH gene expression during diurnal cycles in thermal microbial mats. N and C fixation in the mats contributed ∼3 g N m(-2) per year and 27 g C m(-2) per year, suggesting that these vital demands are fully met by the diazotrophic and photoautotrophic capacities of the cyanobacteria in the Porcelana hot spring.

AB  - The vulnerability of Amazonian rainforest, and the ecological services it provides, depends on an adequate supply of dry-season water, either as precipitation or stored soil moisture. How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario. We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends, the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy - savannah-prone - dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the â € model democracy'view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.

AB  - Considering the role that higher education institutions (HEIs) play in terms of catalysing change within societies, over the past years, sustainability initiatives within HEIs have flourished worldwide. Likewise, the scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change has been on the political and academic agenda for decades, thus, the importance of ameliorating climate change education and literacy both at the society and university training levels. Accordingly, certain questions arise: What are the most effective current climate change educational methodologies? Which road map would be the most appropriate to be suggested to HEIs to promote climate change literacy for future professionals? In order to begin addressing these questions, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences of the University of Chile (FCFM) approach to climate change teaching and literacy is here described. The later contemplates the history of the institutionalisation of sustainability at the FCFM, collection of courses and minors for students which incorporate climate change related-topics, as well as climate change related research centres.

AB  - The 2011 eruption in the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex deposited up to 50 cm of tephra in a plume that intersected the crest of the Andes along Route 215, offering an excellent opportunity to study disturbance effects on native forests along a gradient of tephra depth. Our observations focused on short-term, species-level, tree mortality and sprouting and tephra fall effects on foliage and limb fall. More than 80 % of the thickest deposits were composed of a basal, pumice, gravel layer containing individual clasts up to 6 cm in length overlain by finer gravel and capped by several cm of sandy tephra. In a sample of four plots with tephra thickness ranging from 10 to 50 cm, we observed a wide range of tree mortality: about 8 % of stems living at the time of the eruption were killed by 10 cm of tephra fall and 54 % were killed by 50 cm. However, properties of the affected forest, such as species composition, foliage sprouting and retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics, and tree size/age, strongly influenced survival. The sites with 35 and 50 cm thick deposits were dominated by the deciduous tree Nothofagus pumilio, which was leafless in the austral winter, season of the initial phase of the eruption. The evergreen tree N. dombeyi experienced much higher mortality. The low density of the falling pumice particles appeared to cause minimal abrasion of the canopy.

AB  - The recent hiatus in global warming is likely to be reflected in Andean temperature, given its close dependence on tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1σ model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO. ©2015.

AB  - Episodic air quality degradation due to particles occurs in multiple cities in central and southern Chile during the austral winter reaching levels up to 300–800 µg/m3 hourly PM2.5, which can be associated with severe effects on human health. An air quality prediction system is developed to predict such events in near real time up to 3 days in advance for nine cities with regular air quality monitoring: Santiago, Rancagua, Curicó, Talca, Chillan, Los Ángeles, Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno. The system uses the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model configured with a nested 2 km grid-spacing domain to predict weather and inert tracers. The tracers are converted to hourly PM2.5 concentrations using an observationally based calibration which is substantially less computationally intensive than a full chemistry model. The conversion takes into account processes occurring in these cities, including higher likelihood of episode occurrence during weekends and during colder days, the latter related to increased wood-burning-stove activity for heating. The system is calibrated and evaluated for April–August 2014 where it has an overall skill of 53–72% of episodes accurately forecasted (61–76% for the best initialization) which is better than persistence for most stations. Forecasts one, two, and three days in advance all have skill in forecasting events but often present large variability within them due to different meteorological initializations. The system is being implemented in Chile to assist authority decisions not only to warn the population but also to take contingency-based emission restrictions to try to avoid severe pollution events.

AB  - Cold-water coral ecosystems present common carbonate factories along the Atlantic continental margins, where they can form large reef structures. There is increasing knowledge on their ecology, molecular genetics, environmental controls and threats available. However, information on their carbo-nate production and accumulation is still very limited, even though this information is essential for their evaluation as carbonate sinks. The aim of this study is to provide high-resolution reef aggradation and carbonate accumulation rates for Norwegian cold-water coral reefs from various settings (sunds, inner shelf and shelf margin). Furthermore, it introduces a new approach for the evaluation of the cold-water coral preservation within cold-water coral deposits by computed tomography analysis. This approach allows the differentiation of various kinds of cold-water coral deposits by their macrofossil clast size and orientation signature. The obtained results suggest that preservation of cold-water coral frameworks in living position is favoured by high reef aggradation rates, while preservation of coral rubble prevails by moderate aggradation rates. A high degree of macrofossil fragmentation indicates condensed intervals or unconformities. The observed aggradation rates with up to 1500 cm kyr−1 exhibit the highest rates from cold-water coral reefs so far. Reef aggradation within the studied cores was restricted to the Early and Late Holocene. Available datings of Norwegian cold-water corals support this age pattern for other fjords while, on the shelf, cold-water coral ages are reported additionally from the early Middle Holocene. The obtained mean carbonate accumulation rates of up to 103 g cm−2 kyr−1 exceed previous estimates of cold-water coral reefs by a factor of two to three and by almost one order of magnitude to adjacent sedimentary environments (shelf, slope and deep sea). Only fjord basins locally exhibit carbonate accumulation rates in the range of the cold-water coral reefs. Furthermore, cold-water coral reef carbonate accumulation rates are in the range of tropical reef carbonate accumulation rates. These results clearly suggest the importance of cold-water coral reefs as local, maybe regional to global, carbonate sinks.

AB  - The nosZ gene, which encodes for N2 O reduction to N2 , was used to study the structure of denitrifying communities in the oxygen minimum zone off Chilean and Peruvian coast throughout terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and cloning of nosZ genes. TRFLP analysis showed little diversity of nosZ genes at suboxic depths (Oxygen Minimum Zone´s core) compared with depths where O2 largely varied (upper limit of OMZ or ULOMZ). The nosZ-denitrifying communities showed differences in its structure between geographical locations and time sampling suggesting an association with the shift in the environmental conditions. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that the environmental parameters selected as predictor variables (N2 O, O2 , NH4 + and NO2 -) explained well the differences in nosZ-denitrifying community composition among sampling sites. The phylogenetic analysis showed little nosZ sequence diversity and grouped 81% of nosZ-clones near the cluster of sediments sequences from Pacific. Our sequences did not branch with any known denitrifying bacteria or seawater nosZ-sequences available, demonstrating the novelty of phylotypes founded in this area.

AB  - Little is known about how old-growth and massive forests are responding to environmental change. We investigated tree-ring growth and carbon isotopes of the long-lived and high biomass Fitzroya cupressoides in two stands growing in contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range (∼300 years old) and Andean Cordilleras (>1500 years old) of southern Chile. The interannual variability in δ13C was assessed for the period 1800–2010, and changes in discrimination and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) were evaluated in relation to changes in climate and tree-ring growth during the last century. 13C discrimination has significantly decreased, and iWUE has increased since the 1900s in both sites. However, these trends in isotopic composition have been accompanied by different growth patterns: decreasing growth rates in the Coastal Range since the 1970s and increasing growth rates in the Andes since the 1900s. Trees growing in the Coastal Range have become more efficient in their use of water, probably due to reduced stomatal conductance caused by increases in CO2 and warming. Trees growing in the Andes have also become more water use efficient, but this has been likely due to increased photosynthetic rates. Fitzroya forests, including particularly old-growth stands, are responding to recent environmental changes, and their response has been site dependent. The growth of forests under a more Mediterranean climate influence and restrictive soil conditions in the Coastal Range has been more negatively affected by current warming and drying; while the growth of old stands in thewet Andes has been positively affected by changes in climate (decreasing cloudiness) and increasing CO2. Permanent monitoring of these endangered forests under ongoing environmental changes is needed in order to reassure the long-term preservation of this millennial-aged species.

AB  - Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales.

In this study we assess the main environmental variables that best explain present day presence of the world's highest elevation woodlands in the South American Altiplano, and model how climate change may affect the future distribution of this unique ecosystem under different climate change scenarios. These woodlands are dominated by Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species that forms unique biological communities with important conservation value. Our results indicate that five environmental variables are responsible for 91% and 90.3% of the present and future P. tarapacana distribution models respectively, and suggest that at the end of the 21st century, there will be a significant reduction (56%) in the potential habitat for this species due to more arid conditions. Since it is predicted that P. tarapacana's potential distribution will be severely reduced in the future, we propose a new network of national protected areas across this species distribution range in order to insure the future conservation of this unique ecosystem. Based on an extensive literature review we identify research topics and recommendations for on-ground conservation and management of P. tarapacana woodlands.

AB  - Ecological disturbances triggered by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are of fundamental importance in structuring the temperate forests of southwestern South America and New Zealand. We review studies of the ecological effects of these tectonic phenomena and how they have been central to progress in the modern development of forest ecology in both regions. Studies of tectonic influences on the dynamics of southern temperate rainforests of Chile and New Zealand published in the 1970s and early 1980s contributed prominently to the shift away from the equilibrium paradigms dominant globally in the 1960s and towards modern non- equilibrium frameworks of forest dynamics. Empirical studies of tectonic ecology in these temperate forests in combination with critical evaluations of earlier successional theory have significantly advanced understanding of the roles of coarse scale disturbance in the dynamics of forests in southwestern South America and New Zealand. Recognition that cohort forest For Peer Review Only structures triggered by exogenous disturbances such as wind storms and tectonic events are the norm rather than all-aged structures has been of fundamental importance to understanding the dynamics of these forests. The non-equilibrium patch dynamics framework for interpreting forest structure and dynamics bolstered by tectonic ecology studies in southern South America and New Zealand was of key importance in refining older views of these forests as being out of equilibrium with contemporary climate, revising understanding of the effects of introduced browsing animals on forest structure, and guiding the development of appropriate forest management practices.

AB  - On 4 and 8 January 2014, at the height of the austral summer, intense wildfires in forests and dry pastures occurred in the Melipilla sector, located about 70 km to the southwest of Santiago, the Chilean capital, affecting more than 6 million inhabitants. Low level winds transported the forest fire plume towards Santiago causing a striking decrease in visibility and a marked increase in the concentration of both primary (PM10 and CO) and secondary (Ozone) pollutants in the urban atmosphere. In particular, ozone maximum concentrations in the Santiago basin reached hourly averages well above 80 ppb, the national air quality standard. This ozone increase took place at the three sampling sites considered in the present study. These large values can be explained in terms of high NOx concentrations and NO2/NO ratios in biomass burning emissions.

AB  - Temperate forest represents the smallest area among the main world's forest biomes, but is one of those most threatened by forest loss. Chile contains most of the temperate forest in South America and more than half of the temperate forest in the southern hemisphere. Chilean temperate forest is considered to be one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. In this study we assessed the rate of land use and land cover (LULC) change over time, identified the main LULCs replacing native forest, and described how changes have evolved in contrasting physiographical conditions and through different historical phases of the landscape over the last 40 years. To achieve this, we analysed LULC change with particular focus on forest cover in three areas representing different physiographical conditions and histories of human occupation in the Araucanía Region of Chile, namely the Central Valley, the Coastal range, and the Andean range. We found substantial differences in temporal and intra-regional patterns of forest loss and LULC change. In the Central Valley, forest loss started long ago, and the area occupied by native forest nowadays is less than 5% of the landscape. In the Coastal range, rapid land cover change has taken place since 1973, with an increasing rate of forest loss over time. We detected a similar but less intense pattern in the forests of the Andean range. Overall, the general pattern points to a process of landscape homogenization in all three physiographical areas. Exotic tree plantations have spread over large geographical areas, becoming the dominant land cover. Land cover change in the Araucanía Region reflects a model of change in which areas with better environmental conditions and accessibility are occupied first for productive activities. As the availability of suitable areas for the expansion of productive activities diminishes, these activities start to move into physiographical areas which were previously “protected” by adverse environmental conditions or poor accessibility. This model of production growth could lead to the complete deforestation of areas outside national protected areas, and other areas which still remain inaccessible due to technological restrictions on exploitation.

T2  - Journal of Coastal Research
AB  - Regional sea-level change for Chile is considered until the end of the 21st century for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The main components that contribute to sea-level change are analyzed and summed to achieve a total estimate of sea-level change along the coast of Chile and in the Southeast Pacific. Included are the steric/dynamic component, the contribution from land ice loss and the sea- level change due to the glacial isostatic adjustment. Regional fingerprints and global means are combined to estimate sea-level change in this area. For the steric/dynamic component two different estimates are considered. The results are compared to those found in the IPCC AR5 report. The total mean sea-level rise along the coast lies between 34 cm and 52 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario and between 46 cm and 74 cm for the RCP8.5 scenario, depending on the location and the steric/dynamic component estimate considered. This component is the main contribution in each scenario. All estimates show a modest, relatively constant decrease in sea-level rise along the coast from north to south.

AB  - This study presents newly obtained coral ages of the cold-water corals Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata collected in the Alboran Sea and the Strait of Sicily (Urania Bank). These data were combined with all available Mediterranean Lophelia and Madrepora ages compiled from literature to conduct a basin-wide assessment of the spatial and temporal occurrence of these prominent framework-forming scleractinian species in the Mediterranean realm and to unravel the palaeo-environmental conditions that controlled their proliferation or decline. For the first time special focus was placed on a closer examination of potential differences occurring between the eastern and western Mediterranean sub-basins. Our results clearly demonstrate that cold-water corals occurred sparsely in the entire Mediterranean during the last glacial before becoming abundant during the Bølling-Allerød warm interval, pointing to a basin-wide, almost concurrent onset in (re-)colonisation after ∼13.5. ka. This time coincides with a peak in meltwater discharge originating from the northern Mediterranean borderlands which caused a major reorganisation of the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. During the Younger Dryas and Holocene, some striking differences in coral proliferation were identified between the sub-basins such as periods of highly prolific coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Younger Dryas and in the western basin during the Early Holocene, whereas a temporary pronounced coral decline during the Younger Dryas was exclusively affecting coral sites in the Alboran Sea. Comparison with environmental and oceanographic data revealed that the proliferation of the Mediterranean corals is linked with enhanced productivity conditions. Moreover, corals thrived in intermediate depths and showed a close relationship with intermediate water mass circulation in the Mediterranean sub-basins. For instance, reduced Levantine Intermediate Water formation hampered coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during sapropel S1 event as reduced Winter Intermediate Water formation did in the westernmost part of the Mediterranean (Alboran Sea) during the Mid-Holocene. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates the importance to consider region-specific environmental changes as well as species-specific environmental preferences in interpreting coral chronologies. Moreover, it highlights that the occurrence or decline of cold-water corals is not controlled by one key parameter but rather by a complex interplay of various environmental variables.

AB  - Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloé Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 ± 0.77 kg C m−2, which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.

AB  - In the last decades, forest fires have been a concern in different regions of the world, especially by increased occurrences product of human activities and climate changes. In this study the spatio-temporal trends in the occurrence and area affected by fire in the Maule region during the period 1986-2012 were examined. We use the Corporación Nacional Forestal fire database, whose records were spatially represented by a grid of 2x2 km. The occurrence was stable during the analyzed period with an average of 378 events per year. The burned area presented three periods above average with 5.273 hectares per year. Most of the fires affected surfaces of less than 5 hectares, while a very small number of events explain most of the area annually burned in the region. According to the startup fuel, we found an increasing number of events initiated in forest plantations in contrast to the decreasing number of fires originated in the native forests. Causes of fires associated with transit and transportation were the most important. The number of events accidentally caused by burning waste significantly increased in the period studied. Most of the fires occurred in the coastal area and the central valley, strongly associated with the road network and the most populated cities. This work represents an important contribution to the characterization of forest fires in the region of Maule, being the first to represent the fire statistics in Chile in a spatially explicit way.

AB  - Archaeological sites composed only of surficial lithics are widespread in arid environments. Numerical dating of such sites is challenging, however, and even establishing a relative chronology can be daunting. One potentially helpful method for assigning relative chronologies is to use lithic weathering, on the assumption that the most weathered artifacts are also the oldest. Yet, few studies have systematically assessed how local environmental processes affect weathering of surficial lithics. Using macroscopic analyses, we compared the weathering of surficial lithic assemblages from seven mid-to-late Holocene archaeological sites sampled from four different microenvironments in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Changes in polish, texture, shine, and color were used to establish significant differences in weathering between two kinds of locations: interfluves and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites were moderately to highly weathered by wind and possessed a dark coating, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered despite greater exposure to moisture, often lacked indications of eolian abrasion, and lacked dark coatings. Our results show that lithic weathering can be used as a proxy for relative age, but only after considering local environmental factors. The power of such chronologies can be improved by combining archaeological, paleoenvironmental, geomorphological, and taphonomic data.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres
AB  - The orographic effect of the Andes (30°S–55°S) on upwind precipitating clouds from midlatitude frontal systems is investigated using surface and satellite data. Rain gauges between 33°S and 44°S indicate that annual precipitation increases from the Pacific coast to the windward slopes by a factor of 1.8 ± 0.3. Hourly gauges and instantaneous satellite estimates reveal that the cross-barrier increase in annual precipitation responds to an increase in both the intensity and frequency of precipitation. CloudSat satellite data indicate that orographic effects of the Andes on precipitating ice clouds increase gradually from midlatitudes to subtropics, likely as a result of a reduction of synoptic forcing and an increase of the height of the Andes equatorward. To the south of 40°S, the thickness of clouds slightly decreases from offshore to the Andes. The total ice content increases substantially from the open ocean to the coastal zone (except to the south of 50°S, where there is no much variation over the ocean), and then experience little changes in the cross-mountain direction over the upstream and upslope sectors. Nevertheless, the maximum ice content over the upslope sector is larger and occurs at a lower level than their upwind counterparts. In the subtropics, the offshore clouds contain almost no ice, but the total and maximum ice content significantly increases toward the Andes, with values being much larger than their counterparts over the extratropical Andes. Further, the largest amounts of cloud ice are observed upstream of the tallest Andes, suggesting that upstream blocking dominates there.

AB  - Second-growth forests represent the greatest potential resource for forest management and large-scale ecological restoration in many regions. In south-central Chile, second-growth forests include those dominated by Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , Drimys winteri , and a mixture of evergreen species, especially hardwoods. This article examines the influence of fire and logging on the establishment patterns and development of second-growth forests in south-central Chile. We characterize the size structure and composition of these four types of forests with sampling plots. The identification of the type of disturbance and its date of occurrence was determined from evidence such as fire scars and even-aged pulses of tree establishment. The size, structure and species composition of these forests indicate an intermediate state of development with an average density and basal area ranging from 1294 to 5038 trees ha -1 and from 59 to 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectively. Logging and/or devastating fires that occurred in the early decades of the 1900s promoted the relatively rapid establishment and growth of pioneer species ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). In the Mixed Evergreen second-growth forests, mid-shade or shade tolerant species (e.g., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia, Amomyrtus luma, and A. meli ) became established mostly through vegetative sprouting. Fires and logging have been pervasive factors in determining the structural and compositional uniformity of the native forests of south-central Chile. Ecological restoration at a landscape level, either by ecological processes (i.e., a reduction in fire frequency) and/or the structure and composition of second-growth forests, provide a relevant approach to accelerating the generation of attributes of old-growth forests, therefore meeting manifold societal demands for forest goods and services. Los bosques secundarios representan el mayor recurso forestal para el manejo y la restauración de gran escala en muchas regiones del mundo. En el centro-sur de Chile los bosques secundarios están dominados por Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , D. winteri , y Siempreverde mixtos. El presente artículo examina la influencia del fuego y tala en los patrones de establecimiento y desarrollo de bosques secundarios de la región centro-sur de Chile. Para la caracterización de la estructura y composición de cada bosque secundario se seleccionaron rodales representativos estableciendo 4-6 parcelas de 900 m 2 . El tipo de disturbio y su fecha de ocurrencia fue establecido a través de evidencias tales como cicatrices de fuego y pulsos de establecimiento de árboles. La estructura de tamaños y composición indican un estado de desarrollo intermedio o de reiniciación del sotobosque presentando en promedio una densidad y área basal que varía entre 1294 y 5038 árboles ha -1 y entre 59 y 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectivamente. Incendios de gran severidad y/o madereo ocurridos en las primeras décadas de los 1900 promovieron un rápido establecimiento de las principales especies pioneras ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). En los bosques secundarios Siempreverde mixtos, el establecimiento de especies tolerantes o semi-tolerantes a la sombra (ej., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia ), fue principalmente por rebrotes vegetativos. El fuego y madereo han sido agentes clave en determinar la uniformidad estructural y composicional de los bosques nativos del centro-sur de Chile. La restauración ecológica a escala de paisaje, tanto de procesos ecológicos (frecuencia incendios) como de la estructura y composición de los bosques secundarios, ofrece una relevante aproximación para acelerar la generación de atributos de bosques antiguos que satisfagan los múltiples bienes y servicios ecosistémicos demandados por la sociedad.

AB  - Plant growth at extremely high elevations is constrained by high daily thermal amplitude, strong solar radiation, and water scarcity. These conditions are particularly harsh in the tropics, where the highest elevation treelines occur. In this environment the maintenance of a positive carbon balance involves protecting the photosynthetic apparatus and taking advantage of any climatically favorable periods. To characterize photoprotective mechanisms at such high elevations, and particularly to address the question of whether these mechanisms are the same as those previously described in woody plants along extratropical treelines, we have studied photosynthetic responses in Polylepis tarapacana in the central Andes (18 °S) along an elevational gradient from 4,300 to 4,900 m. For comparative purposes this gradient has been complemented with a lower elevation site (3,700 m) where another Polylepis species (P. rugulosa) occurs. During the daily cycle, two periods of photosynthetic activity were observed: one during the morning when, despite low temperatures, assimilation was high; and the second starting at noon when the stomata closed because of a rise in the vapor pressure deficit and thermal dissipation is prevalent over photosynthesis. From dawn to noon there was a decrease in the content of antenna pigments (chlorophyll b and neoxanthin), together with an increase in the content of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. These results could be caused by a reduction in the antenna size along with an increase in photo-protection. Additionally, photo-protection was enhanced by a partial overnight retention of de-epoxised xanthophylls. The unique combination of all of these mechanisms made possible the efficient use of the favorable conditions during the morning while still providing enough protection for the rest of the day. This strategy differs completely from that of extratropical mountain trees, which uncouple light-harvesting and energy-use during long periods of unfavorable, winter conditions.

It covers interannual to high frequency time scales in an area of about 82,500 km<sup>2</sup> in the eastern South Pacific (ESP). Because heterotrophic N<inf>2</inf> fixation may be regulated by DOM availability in the ESP, we conducted experiments at different oxygen conditions and included DOM amendments in order to test diazotrophic activity. Rates in the euphotic zone showed strong temporal variability which resulted in values reaching 0.5 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in 2006 (average 0.32 ± 0.17 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and up to 126.8 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (average 24.75 ± 37.9 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) in 2011. N<inf>2</inf> fixation in subsurface suboxic conditions (1.5 ± 1.16 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) also occurred mainly during late summer and autumn while virtually absent in winter. The diversity of diazotrophs was dominated by heterotrophs, with higher richness in surface compared to OMZ waters. Rates in oxygen depleted conditions could exceed values obtained in the euphotic layer, but rates were not dependent on the availability of dissolved organic matter. N<inf>2</inf> fixation also showed a positive correlation with total chlorophyll and the C:N ratio of phytoplankton, but not to the P excess compared to N. We conclude that the diazotrophic community responds to the composition of phytoplankton rather than the extent of N deficiency and the availability of bulk DOM in this system. Key Points: The largest N<inf>2</inf> fixation data set for the Eastern South Pacific is presented N<inf>2</inf> fixation activity decreases from coast to open ocean N<inf>2</inf> fixation is likely to be dominated by heterotrophic bacterioplankton

AB  - Projected future trends in water availability are associated with large uncertainties in many regions of the globe. In mountain areas with complex topography, climate models have often limited capabilities to adequately simulate the precipitation variability on small spatial scales. Also, their validation is hampered by typically very low station density. In the Central Andes of South America, a semi-arid high-mountain region with strong seasonality, zonal wind in the upper troposphere is a good proxy for interannual precipitation variability. Here, we combine instrumental measurements, reanalysis and paleoclimate data, and a 57-member ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations to assess changes in Central Andes precipitation over the period AD 1000–2100. This new database allows us to put future projections of precipitation into a previously missing multi-centennial and pre-industrial context. Our results confirm the relationship between regional summer precipitation and 200 hPa zonal wind in the Central Andes, with stronger Westerly winds leading to decreased precipitation. The period of instrumental coverage (1965–2010) is slightly dryer compared to pre-industrial times as represented by control simulations, simulations from the past Millennium, ice core data from Quelccaya ice cap and a tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction. The model ensemble identifies a clear reduction in precipitation already in the early 21st century: the 10 year running mean model uncertainty range (ensemble 16–84% spread) is continuously above the pre-industrial mean after AD 2023 (AD 2028) until the end of the 21st century in the RCP2.6 (RCP8.5) emission scenario. Average precipitation over AD 2071–2100 is outside the range of natural pre-industrial variability in 47 of the 57 model simulations for both emission scenarios. The ensemble median fraction of dry years (defined by the 5th percentile in pre-industrial conditions) is projected to increase by a factor of 4 until 2071–2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Even under the strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions projected by the RCP2.6 scenario, the Central Andes will experience a reduction in precipitation outside pre-industrial natural variability. This is of concern for the Central Andes, because society and economy are highly vulnerable to changes in the hydrological cycle and already have to face decreases in fresh water availability caused by glacier retreat.

T2  - Climate Dynamics
AB  - Our observational analysis shows that the wet seasons of the American monsoon systems have shortened since 1978 due to correlated earlier retreats of the North American monsoon (NAM) and late onsets of the southern Amazon wet season, an important part of the South American monsoon (SAM). These changes are related to the combination of the global sea surface temperature (SST) warming mode, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the westward shift of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), and the enhancement of Pacific South American and Pacific North American wave train patterns, which induces variations of the regional circulation at interannual and decadal scales. The joint contributions from these forcing factors are associated with a stronger and more equatorward regional Hadley cell, which enhances convergence towards the equator, strengthening and possibly delaying the retreat of the tropical part of the NAM. This in turn accelerates the demise of the northern NAM and delays the reversal of the cross-equatorial flow over South America, reducing moisture transport to the SAM and delaying its onset. In addition, the thermodynamic response to warming appears to cause local drier land conditions over both regions, reinforcing the observed changes in these monsoons. Although previous studies have identified the isolated influence of the regional Hadley cell, ENSO, AMO, global SST warming, and NASH on the NAM, the correlated changes between NAM and SAM through variations of the cross-equatorial flow had not been established before.

TI  - The Oldest, Slowest Rainforests in the World? Massive Biomass and Slow Carbon Dynamics of Fitzroya cupressoides Temperate Forests in Southern Chile

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Old-growth temperate rainforests are, per unit area, the largest and most long-lived stores of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere, but their carbon dynamics have rarely been described. The endangered Fitzroya cupressoides forests of southern South America include stands that are probably the oldest dense forest stands in the world, with long-lived trees and high standing biomass. We assess and compare aboveground biomass, and provide the first estimates of net primary productivity (NPP), carbon allocation and mean wood residence time in medium-age stands in the Alerce Costero National Park (AC) in the Coastal Range and in old-growth forests in the Alerce Andino National Park (AA) in the Andean Cordillera. Aboveground live biomass was 113-114 Mg C ha(-1) and 448-517 Mg C ha(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Aboveground productivity was 3.35-3.36 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and 2.22-2.54 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AA, values generally lower than others reported for temperate wet forests worldwide, mainly due to the low woody growth of Fitzroya. NPP was 4.21-4.24 and 3.78-4.10 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Estimated mean wood residence time was a minimum of 539-640 years for the whole forest in the Andes and 1368-1393 years for only Fitzroya in this site. Our biomass estimates for the Andes place these ecosystems among the most massive forests in the world. Differences in biomass production between sites seem mostly apparent as differences in allocation rather than productivity. Residence time estimates for Fitzroya are the highest reported for any species and carbon dynamics in these forests are the slowest reported for wet forests worldwide. Although primary productivity is low in Fitzroya forests, they probably act as ongoing biomass carbon sinks on long-term timescales due to their low mortality rates and exceptionally long residence times that allow biomass to be accumulated for millennia.

AB  - The resilience perspective has emerged as a plausible approach to confront the increasingly devastating impacts of disasters; and the challenges and uncertainty climate change poses through an expected rise in frequency and magnitude of hazards. Stakeholder participation is posited as pivotal for building resilience, and resilience is not passive; rather, stakeholders are actively involved in the process of building resilience. Who is involved and how they are involved are crucial aspects for developing resilience in practice. Nevertheless, there are few empirical studies available to inform theory or show how these issues are addressed. This study focuses on revealing how practitioners frame the issue of participation in relation to resilience, its relevance to a changing climate and how, in consequence, they construct practices.

AB  - Seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of biogeochemical variables, including nitrous oxide (N2O), an important climate active gas, were analyzed during monthly observations between 2002 and 2012 at an ocean Time-Series station in the coastal upwelling area off central Chile (36° 30.8′; 73° 15′). Oxygen, N2O, nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) showed clear seasonal variability associated with upwelling favorable winds (spring–summer) and also inter-annual variability, which in the case of N2O was clearly observed during the occurrence of N2O hotspots with saturation levels of up to 4849%. These hotspots consistently took place during the upwelling-favorable periods in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011, below the mixed layer (15–50 m depth) in waters with hypoxia and some accumulation. The N2O hotspots displayed excesses of N2O (ΔN2O) three times higher than the average monthly anomalies (2002–2012). Estimated relationships of ΔN2O versus apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and ΔN2O versus suggest that aerobic ammonium oxidation (AAO) and partial denitrification are the processes responsible for high N2O accumulation in subsurface water. Chl-a levels were reasonably correlated with the presence of the N2O hotspots, suggesting that microbial activities fuelled by high availability of organic matters lead to high N2O production. As a result, this causes a substantial N2O efflux into the atmosphere of up to 260 μmol m−2 d−1. The N2O hotspots are transient events or hot moments, which may occur more frequently than they are observed. If so, this upwelling area is producing and emitting greater than expected amounts of N2O and is therefore an important N2O source that should be considered in the global atmospheric N2O balance.

AB  - The occurrence of a summer DMS paradox in the vast subtropical gyres is a strong matter of debate because approaches using discrete measurements, climatological data and model simulations yielded contradictory results. The major conclusion of the first appraisal of prognostic ocean DMS models was that such models need to give more weight to the direct effect of environmental forcings (e.g. irradiance) on DMS dynamics to decouple them from ecological processes. Here, the relative role of light and phosphorus on summer DMS dynamics in subtropical waters is assessed using the ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model NEMO-PISCES in which macronutrient concentrations were restored to monthly climatological data values to improve the representation of phosphate concentrations. Results show that the vertical and temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMS concentrations observed in the Sargasso Sea during the summer months is captured by the model. Additional sensitivity tests show that the simulated control of phosphorus on surface DMS concentrations in the Sargasso Sea is much more important than that of light. By extending the analysis to the whole North Atlantic Ocean, we show that the longitudinal distribution of DMS during summer is asymmetrical and that a correlation between the solar radiation dose and DMS concentrations only occurs in the Sargasso Sea. The lack of a widespread summer DMS paradox in our model simulation as well as in the comparison of discrete and climatological data could be due to the limited occurrence of phosphorus limitation in the global ocean.

AB  - Glacier behaviour during the mid-Holocene (MH, 6000 years BP) in the Southern Hemisphere provides observational data to constrain our understanding of the origin and propagation of palaeoclimate signals. In this study we examine the climatic forcing of glacier response in the MH by evaluating modelled glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) and climatic conditions during the MH compared with pre-industrial time (PI, year 1750). We focus on the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, specifically Patagonia and the South Island of New Zealand. Climate conditions for the MH were obtained from PMIP2 model simulations, which in turn were used to force a simple glacier mass balance model to simulate changes in ELA. In Patagonia, the models simulate colder conditions during the MH in austral summer (-0.2 °C), autumn (-0.5 °C), and winter (-0.4), and warmer temperatures (0.2 °C) during spring. In the Southern Alps the models show colder MH conditions in autumn (-0.7 °C) and winter (-0.4 °C), warmer conditions in spring (0.3 °C), and no significant change in summer temperature. Precipitation does not show significant changes but exhibits a seasonal shift, with less precipitation from April to September and more precipitation from October to April during the MH in both regions. The mass balance model simulates a climatic ELA that is 15-33 m lower during the MH compared with PI conditions. We suggest that the main causes of this difference are driven mainly by colder temperatures associated with the MH simulation. Differences in temperature have a dual effect on glacier mass balance: (i) less energy is available for ablation during summer and early autumn and (ii) lower temperatures cause more precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain in late autumn and winter, resulting in more accumulation and higher surface albedo. For these reasons, we postulate that the modelled ELA changes, although small, may help to explain larger glacier extents observed by 6000 years BP in South America and New Zealand.

AB  - The literature on ecosystem services mapping presents a diversity of procedures whose consistency might question the reliability of maps for decision-making. This study aims at analyzing the correspondence between the purpose of maps (e.g. land use planning) and the procedures used for mapping (e.g. benefit transfer, ecological transfer). Fifty scientific studies published between 2005 and 2012 were selected and analyzed according to 19 variables, applying independence tests over contingency tables, ANOVA and regression analysis. The results show that most studies declared a decision-making purpose (82%), which in 50% of the cases, was land use planning. Only few relationships were found between variables selected to describe the purpose of the maps and those selected to describe the mapping procedures. Thus for example, maps aimed at supporting land use planning did not include any level of stakeholder participation or scenario analysis, as it would have been expected given this purpose. Likewise, maps were based on either economic value or biophysical transfers, regardless of the spatial and temporal scales of mapping. This generally weak relation between map׳s purposes with the used procedures could explain the still restricted incidence of ES on decision-making by limiting the transmission, comparison and synthesis of results.

AB  - We examine the timing and magnitude of the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the last glacial termination (LGT) in northwestern Patagonia, situated in the middle latitudes of South America. Our data indicate that the main phase of the LGT began with abrupt warm pulses at 17,800 and 17,100calyrs BP, accompanied by rapid establishment of evergreen temperate rainforests and extensive deglaciation of the Andes within 1000 years. This response shows that South American middle-latitude temperatures had approached average interglacial values by 16,800calyrs BP. The temperature rise in northwestern Patagonia coincides with the beginning of major warming and glacier recession in the Southern Alps of New Zealand at southern mid-latitudes on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean. From this correspondence, the warming that began at 17,800calyrs BP appears to have been widespread in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, accounting for at least 75% of the total temperature recovery from the LGM to the Holocene. Moreover, this warming pulse is coeval with the first half of the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) in the North Atlantic region. HS1 featured a decline of North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a southward shift of the westerly wind belt in both hemispheres and of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, as well as a weakening of the Asian monsoon. Along with the initiating trigger, identifying the mechanisms whereby these opposing climate signals in the two polar hemispheres interacted -whether through an oceanic or an atmospheric bipolar seesaw, or both- lies at the heart of understanding the LGT.

AB  - Biodiversity is considered to be an essential element of the Earth system, driving important ecosystem services. However, the conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changingworld is a challenging task which requires cost- efficient and precise monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth native forest ecosystemwas examined. The vascular plant richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub andherb richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As species richness values are typically count data, the cor- responding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error distribution has to be considered. In this context,we compared the suitability of randomforest (RF) and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)with a negative binomial error distribution. Both models were coupled with a feature selection approach to identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three most im- portant predictors for all four layers were altitude above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy height. Thiswas consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's suitability for estimating species richness,which is its capacity to capture three types of information: micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy struc- tural. Generalized LinearModels showed higher performances (r2: 0.66, 0.50, 0.52, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29%, 19.08%, 17.89%, 21.31% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r2: 0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30%, 21.90%, 18.95%, 21.00% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively). Furthermore, the results of the best GLMweremore parsimonious (three predictors) and less biased than the best RFmodels (twelve pre- dictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values, which RF is unable to properly capture. Fromanecological perspective, thepredicted patterns agreedwell with theknown vegetationcomposition of the area. We found especially high species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these areas, overlap- ping distributions of thermopile sclerophyllos species,water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur. The three main conclusions of the study are: 1) appropriatemodel selection is crucialwhenworkingwith biodiver- sitycountdata; 2) the applicationofRFfordatawithnon-symmetricerrordistributions isquestionable; and3) struc- tural and topographic information derived fromLiDAR data is useful for predicting local plant species richness. ©

AB  - Canopy gaps have been recognized as an important process in the regeneration dynamics of Andean old-growth forests (ca. 40º S). The objectives of the study were to determine main tree-fall gap attributes and to assess tree recruitment and growth patterns in tree-fall gaps of two mid-elevation Andean old-growth forests. We measured the canopy and expanded area of each gap, and for the gap-maker species we measured its diameter at breast height (dbh), felling direction and type of treefall. In each gap, tree seedlings, saplings and bamboo culms were counted in subplots. Increment cores of potential successors were obtained to examine growth patterns. There was a larger area in canopy gaps in NF than in STF (25.8 vs. 11.9 %). Expanded gaps were on average larger in NF than in STF (547 vs. 440 m2 ). Most gaps were originated by wind-snap and upturned root-plates of all the major tree species (Laureliopsis philippiana, Saxegothaea conspicua and Dasyphyllum diacanthoides, and Nothofagus dombeyi in NF). The understory species Chusquea culeou was an important competitor in gaps, especially in STF where the bamboo was more effective inhibiting the recruitment of tree seedlings. The successful recruitment of shade-tolerant tree species beneath endogenous tree-fall gaps indicates that these species follow a gap-phase regeneration mode through which –after several growth releases- they can reach the main canopy. These studies could offer valuable insights for the urgently required restoration and management of Andean old-growth forests.

AB  - Mineral dust aerosols play a major role in present and past climates. To date, we rely on climate models for estimates of dust fluxes to calculate the impact of airborne micronutrients on biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a new global dust flux data set for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions based on observational data. A comparison with dust flux simulations highlights regional differences between observations and models. By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of <10ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further ∼10ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation.

TI  - The influence of anoxia and substrate availability on N2O cycling by denitrification in the upper boundary of the oxygen minimum zone off northern Chile
AU  - Castro-González, Maribeb

T2  - Journal of Marine Research
AB  - Strong accumulations of N2O at oxyclines are some of the most conspicuous features of the world’s oceans. However, the origin of these maxima, and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in N2O cycling, remains unclear. In order to gain insight into the importance of denitrification and factors regulating N2O cycling at upper oxyclines in the eastern South Pacific, the production and consumption of N2O by denitrification were measured using a classical acetylene method under induced anoxia with the addition of an electron acceptor (nitrite) and donors (sodium acetate and glucose). The results indicated that decreased O2 clearly affected the ratio in which N2O is reduced to N2 at the midoxycline (∼40 m depth) and at the oxycline’s base (∼80 m depth). Under induced anoxia, higherN2Oproduction (fromNO− 2 toN2Oof 67.2 nM d−1) occurred at 40mdepth, with half of the total quantity being consumed by denitrification (from N2OtoN2 of 32 nM d−1); conversely,100%of theN2Owas reduced toN2 at 80mdepth. In comparison with previously reported results at the base of the oxycline at an offshore station, the addition ofNO− 2 (as sodium nitrite) along with dissolved organic carbon (as sodium acetate and glucose) doubled the net N2O production by denitrification (∼20 nM d−1). Our results suggest that decreasing O2 levels along with an increased availability of NO− 2 and organic compounds in the upper oxycline may impact the N2O/N2 ratio and, therefore, the N2O efflux to the atmosphere

AB  - This article is a review of the science goals and activities initiated within the framework of the Pollution and its Impacts on the South American Cryosphere (PISAC) initiative. Air pollution associated with biomass burning and urban emissions affects extensive areas of South America. We focus on black carbon (BC) aerosol and its impacts on air quality, water availability, and climate, with an emphasis on the Andean cryosphere. BC is one of the key short-lived climate pollutants that is a topic of growing interest for near-term mitigation of these issues. Limited scientific evidence indicates that the Andean cryosphere has already responded to climate change with receding glaciers and snow cover, which directly affect water resources, agriculture, and energy production in the Andean region of South America. Despite the paucity of systematic observations along the Andes, a few studies have detected BC on snow and glaciers in the Andes. These, in addition to existing and projected emissions and weather patterns, suggest a possible contribution of BC to the observed retreat of the Andean cryosphere. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of these issues from scientific and policy perspectives, and propose strategic expansions to the relevant measurement infrastructure in the region.

AB  - Numerous ice core records are now available that cover the Last Glacial cycle both in Greenland and in Antarctica. Recent developments in coherent ice core chronologies now enable us to depict with a precision of a few centuries the relationship between climate records in Greenland and Antarctica over the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period. Stacks of Greenland and Antarctic water isotopic records nicely illustrate a seesaw pattern with the abrupt warming in Greenland being concomitant with the beginning of the cooling in Antarctica at the Antarctic Isotopic Maximum (AIM). In addition, from the precise estimate of chronological error bars and additional high resolution measurements performed on the EDC and TALDICE ice cores, we show that the seesaw pattern does not explain the regional variability in Antarctic records with clear two step structures occurring during the warming phase of AIM 8 and 12. Our Antarctic high resolution data also suggest possible teleconnections between changes in low latitude atmospheric circulation and Antarctic without any Greenland temperature fingerprint.

AB  - Some morphological studies based on the comparisons between two or three species of Aegla indicate that, as an expression of sexual dimorphism, the cephalothorax is longer in males and wider at the posterior end in females. To assess whether this is a general trend, we performed a series of covariational analyses relating the length and posterior width of cephalothorax in 1,242 specimens of both sexes from 17 of the 19 species of Aegla reported from Chile. By using a covariable homologous for all individuals, it was shown that the bias toward females in the posterior cephalothoracic width is greater than the bias toward males in the cephalothoracic length. Additionally, both variables show positive phylogenetic signal, both in each trait individually and their male–female relationship. For the entire Chilean clade of Aegla, both variables showed a narrow covariation pattern influenced by the sex of the individuals. Furthermore, the phylogenetic signal both in each variable individually and the female–male relationships derived from directional phylogenetic comparative analyses suggests that this relationship is inherited by shared common ancestry, restricting their adaptive potential to most probably directions of change. However, within certain limits, this variability has important reproductive and behavioral implications that are directly associated with the fitness of the taxon.

AB  - AIM: Geographic, climatic, and soil factors are major drivers of plant beta diversity, but their importance for dryland plant communities is poorly known. This study aims to: i) characterize patterns of beta diversity in global drylands, ii) detect common environmental drivers of beta diversity, and iii) test for thresholds in environmental conditions driving potential shifts in plant species composition. LOCATION: 224 sites in diverse dryland plant communities from 22 geographical regions in six continents. METHODS: Beta diversity was quantified with four complementary measures: the percentage of singletons (species occurring at only one site), Whittake's beta diversity (β(W)), a directional beta diversity metric based on the correlation in species occurrences among spatially contiguous sites (β(R(2))), and a multivariate abundance-based metric (β(MV)). We used linear modelling to quantify the relationships between these metrics of beta diversity and geographic, climatic, and soil variables. RESULTS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall, and to a lesser extent latitude, were the most important environmental predictors of beta diversity. Metrics related to species identity (percentage of singletons and β(W)) were most sensitive to soil fertility, whereas those metrics related to environmental gradients and abundance ((β(R(2))) and β(MV)) were more associated with climate variability. Interactions among soil variables, climatic factors, and plant cover were not important determinants of beta diversity. Sites receiving less than 178 mm of annual rainfall differed sharply in species composition from more mesic sites (> 200 mm). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall are the most important environmental predictors of variation in plant beta diversity in global drylands. Our results suggest that those sites annually receiving ∼ 178 mm of rainfall will be especially sensitive to future climate changes. These findings may help to define appropriate conservation strategies for mitigating effects of climate change on dryland vegetation.

AB  - The response of the tropical climate in the Indian Ocean realm to abrupt climate change events in the North Atlantic Ocean is contentious. Repositioning of the intertropical convergence zone is thought to have been responsible for changes in tropical hydroclimate during North Atlantic cold spells, but the dearth of high-resolution records outside the monsoon realm in the Indian Ocean precludes a full understanding of this remote relationship and its underlying mechanisms. Here we show that slowdowns of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas stadial affected the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate through changes to the Hadley circulation including a southward shift in the rising branch (the intertropical convergence zone) and an overall weakening over the southern Indian Ocean. Our results are based on new, high-resolution sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope records of well-dated sedimentary archives from the tropical eastern Indian Ocean for the past 45,000 years, combined with climate model simulations of Atlantic circulation slowdown under Marine Isotope Stages 2 and 3 boundary conditions. Similar conditions in the east and west of the basin rule out a zonal dipole structure as the dominant forcing of the tropical Indian Ocean hydroclimate of millennial-scale events. Results from our simulations and proxy data suggest dry conditions in the northern Indian Ocean realm and wet and warm conditions in the southern realm during North Atlantic cold spells.

T2  - Quaternary Science Reviews
AB  - We present a detailed record from Lago Pichilafquén to unravel the vegetation, climate and disturbance history of the lowlands of northwestern Patagonia (40°S) since 14,500calyrBP. The presence of 30 tephras throughout the record attest for the proximity of the site to active volcanic centres and allows assessment of the role of volcanic disturbance on past vegetation and fire regime shifts. We interpretalternations in dominance between North Patagonian and Valdivian rainforests driven by changes in temperature and precipitation of westerly origin at multi-millennial and millennial timescales. These trends were punctuated by centennial-scale changes, most of which were coeval with or immediately followed the deposition of tephras and/or paleofires. We identify departures of the local vegetation from the regional trend between 2400 and 7100calyrBP, which we interpret as a response of rainforest vegetation and local fire regimes to the disturbance effect of tephra deposition near Lago Pichilafquén. We also find that volcanic disturbance promoted consistent increases in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia within 30 years and paleofires between 60 and 120years following tephra deposition. Comparisons with palynological records having similar span, time resolution and age control suggest that regional climate has played a central role on the establishment, composition and maintenance of temperate rainforests. This influence is overprinted by disturbance regimes at the local and landscape level, driving divergences and heterogeneity especially at times of relatively weak climatic forcing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvements in TES materials are important to lower CSP costs, increase energy efficiency and competitiveness with other technologies. A novel alternative examined in this paper is the use of salt mixtures with lithium nitrate that help to reduce the salt’s melting point and improve thermal capacity. This in turn allows the volume of materials required to be reduced. Based on data for commercial plants and the expected evolution of the lithium market, the technical and economic prospects for this alternative are evaluated considering recent developments of Lithium Nitrates and the uncertain future prices of lithium. Through a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis it is concluded that some of the mixtures could allow a reduction in the costs of CSP plants, improving their competitiveness.

TI  - Record-breaking climate anomalies lead to severe drought and environmental disruption in western Patagonia in 2016
AU  - Garreaud, R. D.
T2  - Climate Research
AB  - Traditionally a temperate and hyper-humid region, western Patagonia experienced its most severe drought during the summer and fall of 2016. Along with precipitation deficits larger than 50% there was a similar reduction in river discharge into coastal waters, a decline in vegetation productivity, excessive solar radiation at the surface, and frequent upwelling-favorable wind events offshore. The combination of these regional-scale anomalies seems to have set the stage for environmental disturbances that, although not new in western Patagonia, occurred with unprecedented magnitude, including severe urban air pollution episodes, large forest fires, and the worst ever recorded harmful algae bloom (HAB). The local climate anomalies were in turn related to the concomitant strong El Niño (through atmospheric teleconnections) and, to a lesser extent, anthropogenic climate change mediated by the positive polarity of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and internal variability, as both modes weakened the westerlies. Dryer than present conditions are consistently projected for northern Patagonia during the 21st century as a consequence of anthropogenic increases in radiative forcing; superposition of El Niño events in this altered climate may result in a higher frequency of extreme droughts and environmental disruptions like those observed in 2016.

AB  - Este artículo presenta un análisis de discurso a cuatro medios de prensa digital en Chile respecto a la mitigación y la adaptación al cambio climático. La investigación, sin precedentes para el caso chileno, se orienta a conocer los encuadres noticiosos con que es comunicado el cambio climático, ya que los medios son la principal fuente de información del cambio climático para los tomadores de decisión y la ciudadanía. Los resultados muestran que los definidores primarios del tema son los actores gubernamentales de nivel nacional, y la invisibilización de las personas y organizaciones ciudadanas en el proceso. Vemos así un alto grado de consenso entre los actores visibilizados respecto al encuadre  de oportunidad económica, y la ausencia de encuadres de ecología crítica. Las conclusiones apuntan a que este desbalance podría influir en un diseño de políticas públicas con un sesgo tecnocrático, perdiendo la posibilidad de construir una visión integral del desarrollo del país.

TI  - A plausible atmospheric trigger for the 2017 coastal El Niño: THE 2017 COASTAL EL NIÑO
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - The far eastern tropical Pacific experienced a rapid, marked warming in early 2017, causing torrential rains along the west coast of South America with a significant societal toll in Peru and Ecuador. This strong coastal El Niño was largely unpredicted, even a few weeks before its onset, and it developed differently from either central or eastern events. Here we provide an overview of the event, its impacts and concomitant atmospheric circulation. It is proposed that a remotely forced, sustained weakening of the free tropospheric westerly flow impinging the subtropical Andes leads to a relaxation of the southeasterly (SE) trades off the coast, which in turn may have warmed the eastern Pacific throughout the weakening of upwelling in a near-coastal band and the lessening of the evaporative cooling farther offshore.

AB  - Growing concern about the loss of ecosystem services (ES) promotes their spatial representation as a key tool for the internalization of the ES framework into land use policies. Paradoxically, mapping approaches meant to inform policy decisions focus on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the biophysical supply of ES, largely ignoring the social mechanisms by which these services influence human wellbeing. If social mechanisms affecting ES demand, enhancing it or reducing it, are taken more into account, then policies are more effective. By developing and applying a new mapping routine to two distinct socio-ecological systems, we show a strong spatial uncoupling between ES supply and socio-ecological vulnerability to the loss of ES, under scenarios of land use and cover change. Public policies based on ES supply might not only fail at detecting priority conservation areas for the wellbeing of human societies, but may also increase their vulnerability by neglecting areas of currently low, but highly valued ES supply.

AB  - Spatial environmental heterogeneity influences diversity of organisms at different scales. Environmental filtering suggests that local environmental conditions provide habitat-specific scenarios for niche requirements, ultimately determining the composition of local communities. In this work, we analyze the spatial variation of microbial communities across environmental gradients of sea surface temperature, salinity and photosynthetically active radiation and spatial distance in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. We hypothesize that environmental filters are the main control of the spatial variation of these communities. Thus, strong relationships between community composition and environmental variation and weak relationships between community composition and spatial distance are expected. Combining physical characterization of the water column, cell counts by flow cytometry, small ribosomal subunit genes fingerprinting and next generation sequencing, we contrast the abundance and composition of photosynthetic eukaryotes and heterotrophic bacterial local communities at a submesoscale. Our results indicate that the strength of the environmental controls differed markedly between eukaryotes and bacterial communities. Whereas eukaryotic photosynthetic assemblages responded weakly to environmental variability, bacteria respond promptly to fine-scale environmental changes in this polar marine system.

AB  - In fire-prone ecosystems, many plant species have specialized mechanisms of seed dormancy that ensure a successful recruitment after fire. A well-documented mechanism is the germination stimulated by firerelated cues, such as heat shock and smoke. However, less is known about the role of inhibitory germination signals (e.g. allelopathy) in regulating post-fire recruitment. Plant leachates derived from the unburned vegetation can enforce dormancy by means of allelopathic compounds, acting as a signal of unfavourable (highly competitive) niche for germination in pyrophyte species. Here, we assessed the separate effects of heat shock and plant leachates on seed germination of Drosophyllum lusitanicum, an endangered carnivorous plant endemic to Mediterranean fire-prone heathlands. We performed a germination experiment in which seeds were subjected to three treatments: (1) 5 min at 100 °C, (2) watering with plant leachate, and (3) control. Germination rate and seed viability was determined after 63 days. Heat shock stimulated seed germination in D. lusitanicum while plant leachates had inhibitory germination effects without reducing seed viability. Thus, both positive and negative signals could be involved in its successful post-fire recruitment. Fire would break seed dormancy and stimulate seed germination of D. lusitanicum through high temperatures, but also by eliminating allelochemical compounds from the soil. These results help to understand the population dynamics patterns found for D. lusitanicum in natural populations, and highlight the role of fire in the ecology and conservation of this endangered species. Seed dormancy imposed by plant-derived leachates as an adaptive mechanism should be considered more in fire ecology theory.

AB  - During the last decade, the IUCN has developed criteria analogous to the Red List of Threatened Species to perform similar risk assessment on ecosystems, creating the Red List of Ecosystems methodology. One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is the gathering and availability of the information needed to apply the criteria. We present a complement to the IUCN's methodology to assess the threat level to ecosystems, estimating the spatial and temporal quality of the information available in scientific publications. We did this by applying the IUCN criteria to determine the threat level to the sclerophyll ecosystems of central Chile. Spatially explicit studies that identify disturbances in the structure of the vegetation were selected, making it possible to quantify effectively the reduction in the ecosystems' distribution. The spatial and temporal quality of the assessment were estimated as the percentage of the potential ecosystem distribution and the time frame recommended by the IUCN (50 years), that the studies represented for each ecosystem. The application of the methodology allowed the assessment of a high percentage of the ecosystems (85%), which were classified based on the studies with ranges of temporal quality from 30 to 100% and spatial quality from 12 to 100%. If only the assessments with more than medium spatio-temporal quality are considered (&gt; 50%), eight of the 17 evaluated ecosystems are classified in threat categories, which represents 22.9% of the study area.

AB  - The Chilean Patagonia constitutes one of the most important and extensive fjord systems worldwide, therefore can be used as a natural laboratory to elucidate the pathway of both organic and inorganic matter in the receiving environment. In this study we use data collected during an intensive oceanographic cruise along the Magellan Strait into the Almirantazgo Fjord in southern Patagonia to evaluate how different sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and recycling may impact particulate organic carbon (POC) δ13C and influence the nutrients and carbonate system spatial distribution. The carbonate system presented large spatial heterogeneity. The lowest total alkalinity and DIC were associated to freshwater dilution observed near melting glaciers. The δ13CDIC analysis suggests that most DIC in the upper 50 m depth was not derived from terrestrial organic matter remineralization. 13C-depleted riverine and ice-melting DIC influence the DIC pool along the study area, but due to that DIC concentration from rivers and glaciers is relatively low, atmospheric carbon contribution or biological processes seem to be more relevant. Intense undersaturation of CO2 was observed in high chlorophyll waters. Respired DIC coming from the bottom waters seems to be almost insignificant for the inorganic carbon pool and therefore do not impact significantly the stable carbon isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon and POC in the upper 50 m depth. Considering the combined effect of cold and low alkalinity waters due to ice melting, our results highlight the importance of these processes in determining corrosive waters for CaCO3 and local acidification processes associated to calving glacier in fjord ecosystems.

AB  - A harmful algal bloom (HAB) of the raphidophyta alga Pseudochattonella cf. verruculosa during the 2016 austral summer (February-March) killed nearly 12% of the Chilean salmon production, causing the worst mass mortality of fish and shellfish ever recorded in the coastal waters of western Patagonia. The HAB coincided with a strong El Ninõ event and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode that altered the atmospheric circulation in southern South America and the adjacent Pacific Ocean. This led to very dry conditions and higher than normal solar radiation reaching the surface. Using time series of atmospheric, hydrologic and oceanographic data we show here that an increase in surface water temperature and reduced freshwater input resulted in a weakening of the vertical stratification in the fjords and sounds of this region. This allowed the advection of more saline and nutrient-rich waters, ultimately resulting in an active harmful algal bloom in coastal southern Chile.

AB  - As rainfall in South-Central Chile has decreased in recent decades, local communities and industries have developed an understandable concern about their threatened water supply. Reconstructing streamflows from tree-ring data has been recognized as a useful paleoclimatic tool in providing long-term perspectives on the temporal characteristics of hydroclimate systems. Multi-century long streamflow reconstructions can be compared to relatively short instrumental observations in order to analyze the frequency of low and high water availability through time. In this work, we have developed a Biobío River streamflow reconstruction to explore the long-term hydroclimate variability at the confluence of the Mediterranean-subtropical and the Temperate-humid climate zones, two regions represented by previous reconstructions of the Maule and Puelo Rivers, respectively. In a suite of analyses, the Biobío River reconstruction proves to be more similar to the Puelo River than the Maule River, despite its closer geographic proximity to the latter. This finding corroborates other studies with instrumental data that identify 37.5°S as a latitudinal confluence of two climate zones. The analyzed rivers are affected by climate forcings on interannual and interdecadal time-scales, Tropical (El Niño Southern Oscillation; ENSO) and Antarctic (Southern Annular Mode; SAM). Longer cycles found, around 80-years, are well correlated only with SAM variation, which explains most of the variance in the Biobío and Puelo rivers. This cycle also has been attributed to orbital forcing by other authors. All three rivers showed an increase in the frequency of extreme high and low flow events in the 20th century. The most extreme dry and wet years in the instrumental record (1943-2000) were not the most extreme of the past 400-years reconstructed for the three rivers (1600-2000), yet both instrumental record years did rank in the five most extreme of the streamflow reconstructions as a whole. These findings suggest a high level of natural variability in the hydro-climatic conditions of the region, where extremes characterized the 20th century. This information is particularly useful when evaluating and improving a wide variety of water management models that apply to water resources that are sensitive to agricultural and hydropower industries.

AB  - The Atacama Desert has been pointed out as one of the places on earth where the highest surface irradiance may occur. This area is characterized by its high altitude, prevalent cloudless conditions and relatively low columns of ozone and water vapor. Aimed at the characterization of the solar spectrum in the Atacama Desert, we carried out in February-March 2015 ground-based measurements of the spectral irradiance (from the ultraviolet to the near infrared) at seven locations that ranged from the city of Antofagasta (on the southern pacific coastline) to the Chajnantor Plateau (5,100 m altitude). Our spectral measurements allowed us to retrieve the total ozone column, the precipitable water, and the aerosol properties at each location. We found that changes in these parameters, as well as the shorter optical path length at high-altitude locations, lead to significant increases in the surface irradiance with the altitude. Our measurements show that, in the range 0–5100 m altitude, surface irradiance increases with the altitude by about 27% in the infrared range, 6% in the visible range, and 20% in the ultraviolet range. Spectral measurements carried out at the Izaña Observatory (Tenerife, Spain), in Hannover (Germany) and in Santiago (Chile), were used for further comparisons.

AB  - We propose a new application of inexpensive light-emitting diode (LED)-based Sun photometers, consisting of measuring the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) with high resolution within metropolitan scales. Previously, these instruments have been used at continental scales by the GLOBE program, but this extension is already covered by more expensive and higher-precision instruments of the AERONET global network. For this we built an open source two-channeled LED-based Sun photometer based on previous developments, with improvements in the hardware, software, and modifications on the calibration procedure. Among these we highlight the use of MODTRAN to characterize the effect introduced by using LED sensors in the AOT retrieval, an open design available for the scientific community and a calibration procedure that takes advantage of a CIMEL Sun photometer located within the city, enables the intercomparison of several LED Sun photometers with a common reference. We estimated the root-mean-square error in the AOT retrieved by the prototypes as 0.006 at the 564 nm and 0.009 at the 408 nm. This error is way under the magnitude of the AOT daily cycle variability measured by us in our campaigns, even for distances closer than 15 km. In addition to inner city campaigns, we also show aerosol-tracing applications by measuring AOT variations from the city of Santiago to the Andes glaciers. Measuring AOT at high spatial resolution in urban areas can improve our understanding of urban scale aerosol circulation, providing information for solar energy planning, health policies, and climatological studies, among others.

AB  - Fog water represents an alternative, abundant and currently unexploited fresh water resource in the coastal Atacama Desert (~20°S). Here, the stratocumulus clouds meet the Coastal Cordillera, producing highly dynamic advective marine fog, a major feature of the local climate that provides water to a hyper-arid environment. One of the main issues that arises in harvesting fog water is our limited understanding of the spatial and inter-annual variability of fog clouds and their associated water content. Here we assess the role of regional-wide El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing on local inter-annual fog-water yields along the coast of Atacama. We contrast 17 years of continuous fog-water data, with local and regional atmospheric and oceanographic variables to determine the link between them and the inter-annual dynamics of fog in northern Chile. Sea surface temperature (SST) in ENSO zone 1 + 2 shows significant correlations with offshore and coastal Atacama SST, as well as with local low cloud cover and fog water yields, which go beyond the annual cycle beat, exposing a potential causal link and influence of ENSO on fog along the Atacama. On the inter-annual time scale, we found that when ENSO 3 + 4 zone SST, specifically during summer, overcome a > 1°C temperature threshold, they incite significantly higher summer fog water yields and explain 79% of the fog variability. Furthermore, satellite images displaying regional extent Sc cloud and fog presence during ENSO extremes reveal higher cloud abundance during El Niño at this latitude. However, 75% of the yearly fog water is collected during winter, and does not appear to be affected in a significant manner by Pacific oscillations. Thus, our results suggest that the utilization of fog as a fresh water resource may be sustainable in the future, regardless of ENSO-induced variability in the region.

AB  - Two Holocene tephras encountered in outcrops, cores and trenches in bogs, and lake cores in the area around Cochrane, southern Chile, are identified (based on their age, tephra glass color and morphology, mineralogy, and both bulk and glass chemistry) as H1 derived from Hudson volcano, and MEN1 derived from Mentolat volcano.
New AMS radiocarbon ages indicate systematic differences between those determined in lake cores (MEN1=7,689 and H1=8,440 cal yrs BP) and surface deposits (MEN1=7,471 and H1=7,891 cal yrs BP), with the lake cores being somewhat older. H1 tephra layers range from 8 to 18 cm thick, suggesting that both the area of the 10 cm isopach and the volume of this eruption were larger than previously suggested, but not greatly, and that the direction of maximum dispersion was more to the south. MEN1 tephra layers range from 1-4 cm in thickness, indicating that this was probably a reasonably large (>5 km 3 ) eruption. Some of the lake cores also contain thin layers (<2 cm) of late Holocene H2 tephra and the recent H3 (1991 AD) tephra, both derived from the Hudson volcano. No tephra evidence has been observed for any late Pleistocene tephra, nor for the existence of the supposed Arenales volcano, proposed to be located west of Cochrane.

AB  - The emission of mineral dust aerosols in arid and semiarid regions is a complex process whose representation in atmospheric models remains crude, due to insufficient knowledge about the aerosol lifting process itself, the lack of global data on soil characteristics, and the impossibility for the models to resolve the fine-scale variability in the wind field that drives some of the dust events. As a result, there are large uncertainties in the total emission flux of mineral dust, its natural variability at various timescales, and the possible contribution from anthropogenic land use changes. This work aims for estimating dust emissions and reduces their uncertainty over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula—the largest dust source region of the globe. We use a data assimilation approach to constrain dust emission fluxes at a monthly resolution for 18 subregions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-derived aerosol optical depth is assimilated in a regional configuration of a general circulation model coupled to an aerosol model. We describe this data assimilation system and apply it for 1 year, resulting in a total mineral dust emissions flux estimate of 2900 Tg yr−1 over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula for the year 2006. The analysis field of aerosol optical depth shows an improved fit relative to independent Aerosol Robotic Network measurements as compared to the model prior field.

AB  - During hydrological research in a Chilean swamp forest, we noted a pattern of higher streamflows close to midday and lower ones close to midnight, the opposite of an evapotranspiration (Et)-driven cycle. We analyzed this diurnal streamflow signal (DSS), which appeared mid-spring (in the growing season). The end of this DSS coincided with a sustained rain event in autumn, which deeply affected stream and meteorological variables. A survey along the stream revealed that the DSS maximum and minimum values appeared 6 and 4 hours earlier, respectively, at headwaters located in the mountain forests/ plantations than at the control point in the swamp forest. Et in the swamp forest was higher in the morning and in the late afternoon, but this process could not influence the groundwater stage. Trees in the mountain headwaters reached their maximum Ets in the early morning and/or close to midday. Our results suggest that the DSS is a wave that moves from forests high in the mountains towards lowland areas, where Et is decoupled from the DSS. This signal delay seems to convert the link between streamflow and Et in an apparent, but spurious positive relationship. It also highlights the role of landscape heterogeneity in shaping hydrological processes.

AB  - The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main driver of climate variability at mid to high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, affecting wildfire activity, which in turn pollutes the air and contributes to human health problems and mortality, and potentially provides strong feedback to the climate system through emissions and land cover changes. Here we report the largest Southern Hemisphere network of annually resolved tree ring fire histories, consisting of 1,767 fire-scarred trees from 97 sites (from 22 °S to 54 °S) in southern South America (SAS), to quantify the coupling of SAM and regional wildfire variability using recently created multicentury proxy indices of SAM for the years 1531–2010 AD. We show that at interannual time scales, as well as at multidecadal time scales across 37–54 °S, latitudinal gradient elevated wildfire activity is synchronous with positive phases of the SAM over the years 1665–1995. Positive phases of the SAM are associated primarily with warm conditions in these biomass-rich forests, in which widespread fire activity depends on fuel desiccation. Climate modeling studies indicate that greenhouse gases will force SAM into its positive phase even if stratospheric ozone returns to normal levels, so that climate conditions conducive to widespread fire activity in SAS will continue throughout the 21st century. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Hunter-gatherers collected and used various woody species depending on the landscape, availability of plant communities, and sociocultural considerations. With extensive paleo-wetlands and groundwater-fed oases, the Atacama Desert was interspersed with riparian woodlands that provided vital resources (fuel, water, and game) at the end of the Pleistocene in areas such as the Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) basin. We use anthracological analyses to determine the fuel management strategies of hunter-gatherer societies in this hyperarid environment and explore whether the “Principle of Least Effort” applies. First, we present the combustion qualities and characteristics of woody taxa from the Atacama and analyze possible exploitation strategies. Second, we use anthracological analyses from Quebrada Maní 12 (QM12), a late Pleistocene archaeological site (dated from 12,750 to 11,530 cal B.P.) located in the PdT basin, to show the prevalence of two woody species that were either freshly collected or gathered (very likely on purpose) from subfossil wood. Our results suggest that fuel selection strategies were based on prior knowledge of the qualities of these woody taxa and how they burned. Thus we conclude that fuel management was part of a number of social and economic decisions that allowed for effective colonization of this region. Furthermore, we stress the need for caution when using charcoal to exclusively date archaeological sites located in desert environments.

Las sociedades de cazadores-recolectores del Cono Sur recolectaron y utilizaron diversas especies leñosas dependiendo de las condiciones del paisaje, las comunidades de plantas disponibles y consideraciones socio-culturales. Las cuencas hidrográficas, como Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) en el Desierto de Atacama, contaban con extensos paleo-humedales y oasis sustentados con aguas subterráneas, intercalados con bosques ribereños que proporcionaron recursos vitales (combustible, agua y caza) hacia finales del Pleistoceno. Este estudio utiliza análisis antracológicos para definir las estrategias empleadas por los grupos de cazadores-recolectores para la gestión del combustible en este ambiente híper árido y explorar si dicho comportamiento social puede ser explicado por el “principio del menor esfuerzo”. En primer lugar, se presentan las cualidades y características de quema de los taxones leñosos del Desierto de Atacama y un análisis de sus estrategias de explotación. En segundo lugar, se utilizan los resultados de análisis antracológicos de muestras de carbones y maderas del sitio arqueológico Quebrada Maní 12 (QM12), ubicado en la PdT y asignado al Pleistoceno tardío (datado entre 12.750 y 11.530 cal a.P.). Estos muestran un predominio de dos especies leñosas recogidas como madera fresca ocolectadas, posiblemente en forma intencional, como “madera vieja”. Los resultados revelan que las estrategias de selección del material para la combustión requirieron de un conocimiento previo acerca de cómo se quemaban los taxones leñosos. Consecuentemente, se concluye que la gestión del combustible formó parte de las decisiones sociales y económicas que permitieron una colonización efectiva de esta región. Finalmente, se señala la necesidad de cautela a la hora de interpretar las cronologías arqueológicas basadas exclusivamente en dataciones sobre carbón en sitios ubicados en desiertos.

AB  - South America is experiencing rapid change in forest cover, of both native and planted forest. Forest cover loss is primarily attributable to fire, logging, and conversion of native forest to agriculture, pasture, and forest plantations, and types of change vary within and among the many diverse types of forests in South America. Major changes in forest cover and growing policy concerns underscore an urgent need for research on sustainable forest management and water ecosystem services in South America. Differences in land ownership and management objectives create trade-offs between wood production and water ecosystem services from forests. Work is needed to quantify how forest change and management affect ecosystem services, such as wood production versus water provision. Current scientific understanding of forest management effects on water ecosystem services in South America has important limitations, including a scarcity of long-term records and few long-term integrated watershed studies. Industry, government, universities, and local communities should collaborate on integrated applied studies of forests and water. Data archiving and publically available data are required. The creation of national networks and a multi-country South America network to identify and implement common water research protocols, share results, and explore their implications would promote common and well-supported policies. Hydrologists working in South America are well placed to tackle the challenges and opportunities for collaborative research that will maintain the intrinsic values and water ecosystem services provided by South America's forests.

AB  - To better forecast streamflow and water resource availability, it is important to have an understanding of the meteorological drivers of the orographic precipitation gradient (OPG), especially critical in semiarid mountainous areas. Although forced ascent over topography typically results in precipitation increasing with altitude (positive OPGs), mean annual OPGs and especially OPGs associated with individual storms can change widely in magnitude and even sign. Precipitation measurements from the Elqui Valley in the semiarid Andes of Chile (30°S) reveal a mean annual OPG of 6.3 mm km−1 (millimeters of precipitation over kilometers in elevation) ranging from −42 to 52 mm km−1 for individual storms over the last 35 years (1979–2013). Reanalysis data and precipitation measurements are used to characterize the observed OPG in this region in relation with their synoptic-scale flow. It is found that the Froude number correlates positively with the OPG, reflecting stronger zonal winds and less static stability during storms that have positive OPGs. Altitude of the Andes barrier jet shows only a weak relationship with the OPG. Significant storms with positive OPGs are typically linked with an austral blocking of the westerlies and an equatorward migration of the midlatitude storm track. For negative OPGs, either a cutoff low or the northern edge of a surface migratory cyclone reaches the Elqui Valley in such a way that significant rainfall only occurs in the near-coastal region without major snowfall accumulation over the Andes.

Despite the advances in responding and adapting to droughts (with the development of new policies, for example), droughts continue to cause serious impacts and suffering. Developing well-targeted public policies requires further research on adaptation. Specifically, understanding the public perception of drought can help to identify drivers of and barriers to adaptation and options. This research seeks to understand the public perception of drought in central Chile in order to inform adaptation-related policies and decision-making processes. This study focused on the Mega-drought, which was a protracted dry spell afflicting central Chile since 2010.

AB  - Despite the great number and variety of glaciers in southern South America, in situ glacier mass-balance records are extremely scarce and glacier–climate relationships are still poorly understood in this region. Here we use the longest (>  35 years) and most complete in situ mass-balance record, available for the Echaurren Norte glacier (ECH) in the Andes at  ∼  33.5° S, to develop a minimal glacier surface mass-balance model that relies on nearby monthly precipitation and air temperature data as forcing. This basic model is able to explain 78 % of the variance in the annual glacier mass-balance record over the 1978–2013 calibration period. An attribution assessment identified precipitation variability as the dominant forcing modulating annual mass balances at ECH, with temperature variations likely playing a secondary role. A regionally averaged series of mean annual streamflow records from both sides of the Andes between  ∼  30 and 37° S is then used to estimate, through simple linear regression, this glacier's annual mass-balance variations since 1909. The reconstruction model captures 68 % of the observed glacier mass-balance variability and shows three periods of sustained positive mass balances embedded in an overall negative trend over the past 105 years. The three periods of sustained positive mass balances (centered in the 1920s–1930s, in the 1980s and in the first decade of the 21st century) coincide with several documented glacier advances in this region. Similar trends observed in other shorter glacier mass-balance series suggest that the Echaurren Norte glacier reconstruction is representative of larger-scale conditions and could be useful for more detailed glaciological, hydrological and climatological assessments in this portion of the Andes.

AB  - The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 years ago) is one of the suite of paleoclimate simulations included in the current phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It is an interval when insolation was similar to the present, but global ice volume was at a maximum, eustatic sea level was at or close to a minimum, greenhouse gas concentrations were lower, atmospheric aerosol loadings were higher than today, and vegetation and land-surface characteristics were different from today. The LGM has been a focus for the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) since its inception, and thus many of the problems that might be associated with simulating such a radically different climate are well documented. The LGM state provides an ideal case study for evaluating climate model performance because the changes in forcing and temperature between the LGM and pre-industrial are of the same order of magnitude as those projected for the end of the 21st century. Thus, the CMIP6 LGM experiment could provide additional information that can be used to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity. The design of the Tier 1 LGM experiment (lgm</i>) includes an assessment of uncertainties in boundary conditions, in particular through the use of different reconstructions of the ice sheets and of the change in dust forcing. Additional (Tier 2) sensitivity experiments have been designed to quantify feedbacks associated with land-surface changes and aerosol loadings, and to isolate the role of individual forcings. Model analysis and evaluation will capitalize on the relative abundance of paleoenvironmental observations and quantitative climate reconstructions already available for the LGM.

AB  - Within the earth’s atmosphere, methane (CH4) is one of the most important absorbers of infrared energy. It is recognized that coastal areas contribute higher amounts of CH4 emission; however, there is a lack of accurate estimates for these areas. This is particularly evident within the extensive northern fjord region of Chilean Patagonia, which has one of the highest freshwater runoffs in the world. Oceanographic and biogeochemical variables were analyzed between the Reloncaví fjord (41° S) and the Interior Sea of Chiloé (ISC) (43° S), during the 2013 austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the fjord influences salinity distribution, which clearly delimits the surface (<5 m depth) and subsurface layers (>5 m depth), and also separates the estuarine area from the marine area. In the estuary, the highest CH4 levels are generally observed in the cold and brackish nutrient-depleted surface waters (N- and P-depleted), ranging from 16.97 to 151.4 nM (mean ± SD 52.20 ± 46.49), equivalent to 640–4537% saturation except for the case of Si(OH)4. Conversely, subsurface waters have lower CH4 levels, fluctuating from 14.3 to 29.6 nM (mean ± SD 22.75 ± 4.36 nM) or 552–1087% saturation. A significant negative correlation was observed between salinity and CH4, and a positive correlation between Si(OH)4 and CH4, suggesting that some of the CH4 in estuarine water is due to continental runoff. Furthermore, the accumulation of seston and/or plankton at the pycnocline may potentially generate the accumulation of CH4 via microbial processes, as observed in estuarine waters. By contrast, the marine area (the ISC), which is predominantly made up of modified subantarctic water, has a relatively homogenous CH4 distribution (mean ± SD 9.84 ± 6.20 nM). In comparison with other estuaries, the Reloncaví fjord is a moderate source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with effluxes ranging from 23.9 to 136 μmol m−2 day−1. This is almost double the levels observed in the ISC, which ranges from 22.2 to 46.6 μmol m−2 day−1. Considering that Chilean Patagonia has numerous other fjord systems that are geomorphologically alike, and in some cases have much greater freshwater discharge, this study highlights their potential to be a significant natural source of this greenhouse gas.

AB  - The abundance of the southern Pacific mollusk loco (Concholepas concholepas), among other conspicuous marine supplies, are often cited as critical resources behind the long-term cultural and demographic fluctuations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the coastal Atacama Desert. These societies inhabited one of the world’s most productive marine environments flanked by one the world’s driest deserts. Both of these environments have witnessed significant ecological variation since people first colonized themat the end of the Pleistocene (c. 13,000 cal yr BP). Here, we examine the relationship between the relative abundance of shellfish (a staple resource) along a 9,500-year sequence of archeological shell midden accumulations at Caleta (a small inlet or cove) Vitor, with past demographic trends (established via summed probability distributions of radiocarbon ages) and technological innovations together with paleoceanographic data on past primary productivity. We find that shellfish extraction varied considerably from one cultural period to the next in terms of the number of species and their abundance, with diversity increasing during periods of regionally decreased productivity. Such shifts in consumption patterns are considered community based management decisions, and for the most part they were synchronous with large and unusual regional demographic fluctuations experienced by prehistoric coastal societies in northern Chile. When taken together with their technological innovations, our data illustrates how these human groups tailored their socio-cultural patterns to what were often abrupt and prolonged environmental changes throughout the Holocene.

AB  - Accurate representation of the real spatio-temporal variability of catchment rainfall inputs is currently severely limited. Moreover, spatially interpolated catchment precipitation is subject to large uncertainties, particularly in developing countries and regions which are difficult to access. Recently, satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for a wide range of hydrological applications, from water resources modelling to monitoring of extreme events such as droughts and floods.This study attempts to exhaustively evaluate – for the first time – the suitability of seven state-of-the-art SRE products (TMPA 3B42v7, CHIRPSv2, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIAN-CCS-Adj, MSWEPv1.1, and PGFv3) over the complex topography and diverse climatic gradients of Chile. Different temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) are used in a point-to-pixel comparison between precipitation time series measured at 366 stations (from sea level to 4600 m a.s.l. in the Andean Plateau) and the corresponding grid cell of each SRE (rescaled to a 0.25° grid if necessary). The modified Kling–Gupta efficiency was used to identify possible sources of systematic errors in each SRE. In addition, five categorical indices (PC, POD, FAR, ETS, fBIAS) were used to assess the ability of each SRE to correctly identify different precipitation intensities.Results revealed that most SRE products performed better for the humid South (36.4–43.7° S) and Central Chile (32.18–36.4° S), in particular at low- and mid-elevation zones (0–1000 m a.s.l.) compared to the arid northern regions and the Far South. Seasonally, all products performed best during the wet seasons (autumn and winter; MAM–JJA) compared to summer (DJF) and spring (SON). In addition, all SREs were able to correctly identify the occurrence of no-rain events, but they presented a low skill in classifying precipitation intensities during rainy days. Overall, PGFv3 exhibited the best performance everywhere and for all timescales, which can be clearly attributed to its bias-correction procedure using 217 stations from Chile. Good results were also obtained by the research products CHIRPSv2, TMPA 3B42v7 and MSWEPv1.1, while CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, and the real-time PERSIANN-CCS-Adj were less skillful in representing observed rainfall. While PGFv3 (currently available up to 2010) might be used in Chile for historical analyses and calibration of hydrological models, the high spatial resolution, low latency and long data records of CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42v7 (in transition to IMERG) show promising potential to be used in meteorological studies and water resource assessments. We finally conclude that despite improvements of most SRE products, a site-specific assessment is still needed before any use in catchment-scale hydrological studies.

AB  - Chile hosts some of the sunniest places on earth, which has led to a growing solar energy industry in recent years. However, the lack of high resolution measurements of solar irradiance becomes a critical obstacle for both financing and design of solar installations. Besides the Atacama Desert, Chile displays a large array of "solar climates" due to large latitude and altitude variations, and so provides a useful testbed for the development of solar irradiance maps. Here a new public database for surface solar irradiance over Chile is presented. This database includes hourly irradiance from 2004 to 2016 at 90 m horizontal resolution over continental Chile. Our results are based on global reanalysis data to force a radiative transfer model for clear sky solar irradiance and an empirical model based on geostationary satellite data for cloudy conditions. The results have been validated using 140 surface solar irradiance stations throughout the country. Model mean percentage error in hourly time series of global horizontal irradiance is only 0.73%, considering both clear and cloudy days. The simplicity and accuracy of the model over a wide range of solar conditions provides confidence that the model can be easily generalized to other regions of the world.

T2  - Sustainability Science
AB  - In theory, building resilience is touted as one way to deal with climate change impacts; however, in practice, there is a need to examine how contexts influence the capacity of building resilience. A participatory process was carried out through workshops in regions affected by drought in Chile in 2014. The aim was to explore how resilience theory can be better applied and articulated into practice vis-á-vis participatory approaches that enrich the research process through the incorporation of co-produced. The results show that there are more differences in responses by type of actor than between regions, where issues of national interest, such as ‘education-information’ and ‘preparedness’, are highlighted over others. However, historically relevant local topics emerged as differentiators: decentralisation, and political will. This reinforces why special attention must be given to the different understandings in knowledge co-production processes. This study provides evidence and lessons on the importance of incorporating processes of the co-production of knowledge as a means to better articulate and transfer abstract concepts, such as resilience theory, into practice.

AB  - Socio-economic and environmental changes are well known causes of demographic collapse of agrarian cultures. The collapse of human societies is a complex phenomenon where historical and cultural dimensions play a key role, and they may interact with the environmental context. However, the importance of the interaction between socio-economic and climatic factors in explaining possible breakdowns in Native American societies has been poorly explored. The aim of this study is to test the role of socio-economic causes and rainfall variability in the collapse suffered by the Aymara people of the semiarid Andean region of Tarapacá during the period 1820–1970. Our motivation is to demonstrate that simple population dynamic models can be helpful in understanding the causes and relative importance of population changes in Andean agro-pastoral societies in responses to socio-environmental variability. Simple logistic models that combine the effects of external socio-economic causes and past rainfall variability (inferred from Gross Domestic Product [GDP] and tree-rings, respectively) were quite accurate in predicting the sustained population decline of the Aymara people. Our results suggest that the depopulation in the semiarid Tarapacá province was caused by the interaction among external socio-economic pressures given by the economic growth of the lowlands and demands for labor coupled with a persistent decline in rainfall. This study constitutes an example of how applied ecological knowledge, in particular the application of the logistic equation and theories pertaining to nonlinear population dynamics and exogenous perturbations, can be used to better understand major demographic changes in human societies.

AB  - The Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment (CCOPE) was conducted during the austral winter of 2015 (May-August) in the Nahuelbuta Mountains (peak elevation 1.3 km MSL) of southern Chile (38°S). CCOPE used soundings, two profiling Micro Rain Radars, a Parsivel disdrometer, and a rain gauge network to characterize warm and ice-initiated rain regimes and explore their consequences for orographic precipitation. Thirty-three percent of foothill rainfall fell during warm rain periods, while 50% of rainfall fell during ice-initiated periods. Warm rain drop size distributions were characterized by many more and relatively smaller drops than ice-initiated drop size distributions. Both the portion and properties of warm and ice-initiated rainfall compare favorably with observations of coastal mountain rainfall at a similar latitude in California. Orographic enhancement is consistently strong for rain of both types, suggesting that seeding from ice aloft is not a requisite for large orographic enhancement. While the data suggest that orographic enhancement may be greater during warm rain regimes, the difference in orographic enhancement between regimes is not significant. Sounding launches indicate that differences in orographic enhancement are not easily explainable by differences in low-level moisture flux or nondimensional mountain height between the regimes.

AB  - A growing interest in mapping the social value of ecosystem services (ES) is not yet methodologically aligned with what is actually being mapped. We critically examine aspects of the social value mapping process that might influence map outcomes and limit their practical use in decision making. We rely on an empirical case of participatory mapping, for a single ES (recreation opportunities), which involves diverse stakeholders such as planners, researchers, and community representatives. Value elicitation relied on an individual open-ended interview and a mapping exercise. Interpretation of the narratives and GIS calculations of proximity, centrality, and dispersion helped in exploring the factors driving participants’ answers. Narratives reveal diverse value types. Whereas planners highlighted utilitarian and aesthetic values, the answers from researchers revealed naturalistic values as well. In turn community representatives acknowledged symbolic values. When remitted to the map, these values were constrained to statements toward a much narrower set of features of the physical (e.g., volcanoes) and built landscape (e.g., roads). The results suggest that mapping, as an instrumental approach toward social valuation, may capture only a subset of relevant assigned values. This outcome is the interplay between participants’ characteristics, including their acquaintance with the territory and their ability with maps, and the mapping procedure itself, including the proxies used to represent the ES and the value typology chosen, the elicitation question, the cartographic features displayed on the base map, and the spatial scale.

AB  - The upwelling system off central Chile (36.5 S) is seasonally subjected to oxygen (O2)-deficient waters, with a strong vertical gradient in O2 (from oxic to anoxic conditions) that spans a few metres (30-50€m interval) over the shelf. This condition inhibits and/or stimulates processes involved in nitrogen (N) removal (e.g. anammox, denitrification, and nitrification). During austral spring (September 2013) and summer (January 2014), the main pathways involved in N loss and its speciation, in the form of N2 and/or N2O, were studied using 15N-tracer incubations, inhibitor assays, and the natural abundance of nitrate isotopes along with hydrographic information. Incubations were developed using water retrieved from the oxycline (25€m depth) and bottom waters (85€m depth) over the continental shelf off Concepción, Chile. Results of 15N-labelled incubations revealed higher N removal activity during the austral summer, with denitrification as the dominant N2-producing pathway, which occurred together with anammox at all times. Interestingly, in both spring and summer maximum potential N removal rates were observed in the oxycline, where a greater availability of oxygen was observed (maximum O2 fluctuation between 270 and 40€μmol€L'1) relative to the hypoxic bottom waters ( < €20€μmol€O2€L'1). Different pathways were responsible for N2O produced in the oxycline and bottom waters, with ammonium oxidation and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, respectively, as the main source processes. Ammonium produced by dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNiRA) could sustain both anammox and nitrification rates, including the ammonium utilized for N2O production. The temporal and vertical variability of /15N-NO3' confirms that multiple N-cycling processes are modulating the isotopic nitrate composition over the shelf off central Chile during spring and summer. N removal processes in this coastal system appear to be related to the availability and distribution of oxygen and particles, which are a source of organic matter and the fuel for the production of other electron donors (i.e. ammonium) and acceptors (i.e. nitrate and nitrite) after its remineralization. These results highlight the links between several pathways involved in N loss. They also establish that different mechanisms supported by alternative N substrates are responsible for substantial accumulation of N2O, which are frequently observed as hotspots in the oxycline and bottom waters. Considering the extreme variation in oxygen observed in several coastal upwelling systems, these findings could help to understand the ecological and biogeochemical implications due to global warming where intensification and/or expansion of the oceanic OMZs is projected.

AB  - Making accurate estimations of daily and annual Rs fluxes is key for understanding the carbon cycle process and projecting effects of climate change. In this study we used high-frequency sampling (24 measurements per day) of Rs in a temperate rainforest during 1 year, with the objective of answering the questions of when and how often measurements should be made to obtain accurate estimations of daily and annual Rs. We randomly selected data to simulate samplings of 1, 2, 4 or 6 measurements per day (distributed either during the whole day or only during daytime), combined with 4, 6, 12, 26 or 52 measurements per year. Based on the comparison of partial-data series with the full-data series, we estimated the performance of different partial sampling strategies based on bias, precision and accuracy. In the case of annual Rs estimation, we compared the performance of interpolation vs. using non-linear modelling based on soil temperature. The results show that, under our study conditions, sampling twice a day was enough to accurately estimate daily Rs (RMSE  <  10 % of average daily flux), even if both measurements were done during daytime. The highest reduction in RMSE for the estimation of annual Rs was achieved when increasing from four to six measurements per year, but reductions were still relevant when further increasing the frequency of sampling. We found that increasing the number of field campaigns was more effective than increasing the number of measurements per day, provided a minimum of two measurements per day was used. Including night-time measurements significantly reduced the bias and was relevant in reducing the number of field campaigns when a lower level of acceptable error (RMSE  <  5 %) was established. Using non-linear modelling instead of linear interpolation did improve the estimation of annual Rs, but not as expected. In conclusion, given that most of the studies of Rs use manual sampling techniques and apply only one measurement per day, we suggest performing an intensive sampling at the beginning of the study to determine minimum daily and annual frequencies of sampling.

T2  - Environmental Pollution
AB  - Temuco is a mid-size city representative of severe wood smoke pollution in southern Chile; i.e., ambient 24-h PM2.5 concentrations have exceeded 150 μg/m3 in the winter season and the top concentration reached 372 μg/m3 in 2010. Annual mean concentrations have decreased but are still above 30 μg/m3. For the very first time, a molecular marker source apportionment of ambient organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 was conducted in Temuco. Primary resolved sources for PM2.5 were wood smoke (37.5%), coal combustion (4.4%), diesel vehicles (3.3%), dust (2.2%) and vegetative detritus (0.7%). Secondary inorganic PM2.5 (sulfates, nitrates and ammonium) contributed 4.8% and unresolved organic aerosols (generated from volatile emissions from incomplete wood combustion), including secondary organic aerosols, contributed 47.1%. Adding the contributions of unresolved organic aerosols to those from primary wood smoke implies that wood burning is responsible for 84.6% of the ambient PM2.5 in Temuco. This predominance of wood smoke is ultimately due to widespread poverty and a lack of efficient household heating methods. The government has been implementing emission abatement policies but achieving compliance with ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 in southern Chile remains a challenge.

AB  - Research on climate change policies can contribute to policy development by building an understanding of the barriers faced in policy processes, and by providing knowledge needed throughout policy cycles. This paper explores the thematic coverage of research on climate change policies related to rural areas, rural development, and natural resource management in Latin America. A three-tier framework is proposed to analyse the selected literature. The results show that research studies have focussed on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, and adaptations to climate change in agriculture. There is little policy research on other vulnerable sectors (e.g., water and health) and emitting sectors (e.g., energy and industry) in the context of rural development. Our analysis highlights the various research gaps that deserve increased scientific attention, including: cross-sector approaches, multi-level governance, and the stages of policy adoption, implementation and evaluation. In addition, the selected literature has a limited contribution to theoretical discussions in policy sciences.

AB  - Unicellular cyanobacteria are ubiquitous photoautotrophic microbes that contribute substantially to global primary production. Picocyanobacteria such as  Synechococcus  and  Prochlorococcus  depend on chlorophyll a-binding protein complexes to capture light energy. In addition,  Synechococcus  has accessory pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and  Prochlorococcus  contains chlorophyll  b . Across a surface water transect spanning the sparsely studied tropical Indian Ocean, we examined  Synechococcus  and  Prochlorococcus  occurrence, taxonomy and habitat preference in an evolutionary context. Shotgun sequencing of size fractionated microbial communities from 0.1 μm to 20 μm and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicated that cyanobacteria account for up to 15% of annotated reads, with the genera  Prochlorococcus  and  Synechococcus  comprising 90% of the cyanobacterial reads, even in the largest size fraction (3.0–20 mm). Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial light-harvesting genes (chl-binding  pcb/isi A, allophycocyanin ( apc AB), phycocyanin ( cpc AB) and phycoerythin ( cpe AB)) mostly identified picocyanobacteria clades comprised of overlapping sequences obtained from Indian Ocean, Atlantic and/or Pacific Oceans samples. Habitat reconstructions coupled with phylogenetic analysis of the Indian Ocean samples suggested that large  Synechococcus -like ancestors in coastal waters expanded their ecological niche towards open oligotrophic waters in the Indian Ocean through lineage diversification and associated streamlining of genomes ( e . g . loss of phycobilisomes and acquisition of Chl  b ); resulting in contemporary small celled  Prochlorococcus . Comparative metagenomic analysis with picocyanobacteria populations in other oceans suggests that this evolutionary scenario may be globally important.

AB  - This paper explores the use of active and passive microwave satellite soil moisture products for improving streamflow prediction within four large (>5000km2) semiarid catchments in Australia. We use the probability distributed model (PDM) under a data-scarce scenario and aim at correcting two key controlling factors in the streamflow generation: the rainfall forcing data and the catchment wetness condition. The soil moisture analysis rainfall tool (SMART) is used to correct a near real-time satellite rainfall product (forcing correction scheme) and an ensemble Kalman filter is used to correct the PDM soil moisture state (state correction scheme). These two schemes are combined in a dual correction scheme and we assess the relative improvements of each. Our results demonstrate that the quality of the satellite rainfall product is improved by SMART during moderate-to-high daily rainfall events, which in turn leads to improved streamflow prediction during high flows. When employed individually, the soil moisture state correction scheme generally outperforms the rainfall correction scheme, especially for low flows. Overall, the combined dual correction scheme further improves the streamflow predictions (reduction in root mean square error and false alarm ratio, and increase in correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency). Our results provide new evidence of the value of satellite soil moisture observations within data-scarce regions. We also identify a number of challenges and limitations within the schemes.

AB  - In this paper we assess South American monsoon system (SAMS) variability in the last millennium as depicted by global coupled climate model simulations. High-resolution proxy records for the South American monsoon over this period show a coherent regional picture of a weak monsoon during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and a stronger monsoon during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Due to the small external forcing during the past 1000 years, model simulations do not show very strong temperature anomalies over these two specific periods, which in turn do not translate into clear precipitation anomalies, in contrast with the rainfall reconstructions in South America. Therefore, we used an ad hoc definition of these two periods for each model simulation in order to account for model-specific signals. Thereby, several coherent large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies are identified. The models feature a stronger monsoon during the LIA associated with (i) an enhancement of the rising motion in the SAMS domain in austral summer; (ii) a stronger monsoon-related upper-tropospheric anticyclone; (iii) activation of the South American dipole, which results in a poleward shift of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone; and (iv) a weaker upper-level subtropical jet over South America. The diagnosed changes provide important insights into the mechanisms of these climate anomalies over South America during the past millennium.

AB  - The South Pacific region represents the world's largest oceanic water mass and plays a significant role in the earth's climate systems. This region also contains the largest group of island nations, most of whom are dependent on marine resources for their livelihoods. Several of the largest coastal and oceanic gisheries also occur in this region (FAO, 2014). In addition, for the countries associated with the southern Pacific Ocean region, the sea provides significant social, cultural and economic benefits, with many countries being heavily reliant on both coastal and oceanic marine resources (Bell et al., 2013). Increasing coastal populations and climate change are expected to augment human demands on already fully exploited or over-exploited marine resources, threatening both food security and sustainable livelihoods (Bell et al. 2011). Therefore, its imperative that the science that describes and predicts linked biophysical and human systems is understood and developed to meet these needs. Climate change will have many impacts on marine ecosystems, with implications for end users including individuals, local communities, industries and governments. Improved scientific support for policy and management decision-making in the face of these potential impacts is essential.

AB  - Despite advances in Earth observation and modeling, estimating tropical biomass remains a challenge. Recent work suggests that integrating satellite measurements of canopy height within ecosystem models is a promising approach to infer biomass. We tested the feasibility of this approach to retrieve aboveground biomass (AGB) at three tropical forest sites by assimilating remotely sensed canopy height derived from a texture analysis algorithm applied to the high-resolution Pleiades imager in the Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems Canopy (ORCHIDEE-CAN) ecosystem model. While mean AGB could be estimated within 10% of AGB derived from census data in average across sites, canopy height derived from Pleiades product was spatially too smooth, thus unable to accurately resolve large height (and biomass) variations within the site considered. The error budget was evaluated in details, and systematic errors related to the ORCHIDEE-CAN structure contribute as a secondary source of error and could be overcome by using improved allometric equations.

AB  - Fjords and estuaries exchange large amounts of solutes, gases, and particulates between fluvial and marine systems. These exchanges and their relative distributions of compounds/particles are partially controlled by stratification and water circulation. The spatial and vertical distributions of N2O, an important greenhouse gas, along with other oceanographic variables, are analyzed from the Reloncaví estuary (RE) (~41° 30′ S) to the gulf of Corcovado in the interior sea of Chiloé (43° 45′ S) during the austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the estuary regulated salinity and stratification of the water column, clearly demarking the surface (<5 m depth) and subsurface layer (>5 m depth) and also separating estuarine and marine influenced areas. N2O levels varied between 8.3 and 21 nM (corresponding to 80 and 170 % saturation, respectively), being significantly lower (11.8 ± 1.70) at the surface than in subsurface waters in the Reloncaví estuary (14.5 ± 1.73). Low salinity and NO3 −, NO2 −, and PO4 3− levels, as well as high Si(OH)4 values were associated with low surface N2O levels. Remarkably, an accumulation of N2O was observed in the subsurface waters of the Reloncaví sound, associated with a relatively high consumption of O2. The sound is exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts from aquaculture and urban discharge, occurring simultaneously with an internal recirculation, which leads to potential signals of early eutrophication. In contrast, within the interior sea of Chiloé (ISC), most of water column was quasi homohaline and occupied by modified subantarctic water (MSAAW), which was relatively rich in N2O (12.6 ± 2.36 nM) and NO3 − (18.3 ± 1.63 μM). The relationship between salinity, nutrients, and N2O revealed that water from the open ocean, entering into ISC (the Gulf of Corcovado) through the Guafo mouth, was the main source of N2O (up to 21 nM), as it gradually mixed with estuarine water. In addition, significant relationships between N2O excess vs. AOU and N2O excess vs. NO3 − suggest that part of N2O is also produced by nitrification. Our results show that the estuarine and marine waters can act as light source or sink of N2O to the atmosphere (air–sea N2O fluxes ranged from −1.57 to 5.75 μmol m−2 day−1), respectively; influxes seem to be associated to brackish water depleted in N2O that also caused a strong stratification, creating a barrier to gas exchange.

AB  - The inhabitants of Santiago, Chile have been exposed to harmful levels of air pollutants for decades. The city’s poor air quality is a result of steady economic growth, and stable atmospheric conditions adverse to mixing and ventilation that favor the formation of oxidants and secondary aerosols. Identifying and quantifying the sources that contribute to the ambient levels of pollutants is key for designing adequate mitigation measures. Estimating the evolution of source contributions to ambient pollution levels is also paramount to evaluating the effectiveness of pollution reduction measures that have been implemented in recent decades. Here, we quantify the main sources that have contributed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) between April 1998 and August 2012 in downtown Santiago by using two different source-receptor models (PMF 5.0 and UNMIX 6.0) that were applied to elemental measurements of 1243 24 h filter samples of ambient PM2.5. PMF resolved six sources that contributed to ambient PM2.5, with UNMIX producing similar results: motor vehicles (37.3 ± 1.1 %), industrial sources (18.5 ± 1.3 %), copper smelters (14.4 ± 0.8 %), wood burning (12.3 ± 1.0 %), coastal sources (9.5 ± 0.7 %) and urban dust (3.0 ± 1.2 %). Our results show that over the 15 years analyzed here, four of the resolved sources significantly decreased 95 % confidence interval: motor vehicles 21.3 % 2.6, 36.5, industrial sources 39.3 % 28.6, 48.4, copper smelters 81.5 % 75.5, 85.9, and coastal sources 58.9 % 38.5, 72.5, while wood burning did not significantly change and urban dust increased by 72 % 48.9, 99.9. These changes are consistent with emission reduction measures, such as improved vehicle emission standards, cleaner smelting technology, introduction of low-sulfur diesel for vehicles and natural gas for industrial processes, public transport improvements, etc. However, it is also apparent that the mitigation expected from the above regulations has been partially offset by the increasing amount of private vehicle use in the city, with motor vehicles becoming the dominant source of ambient PM2.5 in recent years. Consequently, Santiago still experiences ambient PM2.5 levels above the annual and 24 h Chilean and World Health Organization standards, and further regulations are required to reach ambient air quality standards

AB  - Lake Big Momela, one of the East African soda lakes in Northern Tanzania characterised by highly saline-alkaline conditions, making them inhospitable to a range of organisms, although supporting massive growths of some adapted planktonic microorganisms that serve as food for birds, such as Lesser Flamingo. The temporal dynamics of plankton, with an emphasis on cyanobacteria, were examined in 2007 using morphological traits and ribosomal genetic markers (16S and 18S rRNA). Cyanobacterial genes encoding for hepatotoxins (mcyE and ndaF) were also screened. Rotifers and copepods dominated the zooplankton, whereas cyanobacteria, such as Anabaenopsis elenkinii and Arthrospira fusiformis dominated the phytoplankton community, and these being related to representatives in other East African soda lakes. The cyanobacteria community also showed distinct seasonal patterns influenced by environmental parameters, mainly salinity, pH and nitrate. Significant positive correlations were found between phytoplankton abundance and nitrate concentrations (r = 0.617, p = 0.033). No signals of the hepatotoxin synthetase genes mcyE and ndaF were retrieved from cyanobacteria during the whole year. In general, our data illustrate the presence of rich planktonic communities, including some unique and potentially endemic cyanobacteria.

AB  - In 2013, the international Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (iCACGP) and the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project Americas Working Group (iCACGP/IGAC AWG) was formed to build a cohesive network and foster the next generation of atmospheric scientists with the goal of contributing to a scientific community focused on building collective knowledge for the Americas. The Latin America–Caribbean (LAC) region shares common history, culture, and socioeconomic issues but, at the same time, it is highly diverse in its physical and human geography. The LAC region is unique because approximately 80% of its population lives in urban areas, resulting in high-density hotspots of urbanization and vast unpopulated rural areas. In recent years, most countries of the region have experienced rapid growth in population and industrialization as their economies emerge. The rapid urbanization, the associated increases in mobile and industrial sources, and the growth of the agricultural activities related to biomass burning have degraded air quality in certain areas of the LAC region. Air pollution has negative implications for human health, ecosystems, and climate. In addition, air pollution and the warming caused by greenhouse gases could impact the melting of Andean glaciers, an important source of freshwater. To better understand the links between air pollution and climate, it is necessary to increase the number of atmospheric scientists and improve our observational, analytical, and modeling capacities. This requires sustained and prioritized funding as well as stronger collaboration within the LAC region.

AB  - Current debate on the implementation of resilience in addressing climatic impacts calls for more pragmatic means of reducing losses. In this study we aimed to generate context-specific knowledge about resilience factors for addressing the impacts of drought, with the expectation that bringing forth experiential knowledge on how impacts were addressed in the past would shed light on what constitutes key resilience factors for practitioners working in urban contexts. The study was carried in three of the largest cities in Chile: Santiago, Concepción, and Valdivia. The analytical framework consists of urban and regional resilience incorporating transdisciplinary approaches applying the Resilience-Wheel tool, combined with participatory methods for the co-production of knowledge and qualitative content analysis of documents and workshops. Results show that key determinants of building resilience to drought were: improving education and access to information, enhancing preparedness, promoting technology transfer, reinforcing organizational linkages and collaboration, decentralizing governance, and encouraging citizen participation. The Resilience-Wheel was useful for navigating the conceptual complexity and diversity of perspectives inherent among social actors. The transdisciplinary approach allowed us to co-produce key knowledge that can be applied to build resilience in future, through a bottom-up approach that bridges the science–policy interface.

AB  - Las iglesias de Chiloé son antiguas estructuras de madera reconocidas patrimonio de la humanidad por la UNESCO. Gran parte de su historia de construcción y reparaciones aún se desconoce. Considerando que muchas de las iglesias de Chiloé fueron construidas utilizando madera de Pilgerodendron uviferum, el objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar el potencial de esta especie para datar piezas de madera de dos de estas históricas construcciones: las iglesias de Vilupulli e Ichuac. En Vilupulli se dataron piezas de 311 y 181 años provenientes de los pilares de la torre. Estas piezas fueron fechadas con cronologías de ancho de anillos de P. uviferum cercanas a las dos iglesias. También utilizando estas cronologías se dataron piezas de 79, 89, 97 y 135 años obtenidas a partir de los pilotes que sostienen el piso de la iglesia de Ichuac. Considerando que Vilupulli fue construida a principios del siglo XX, es posible que las muestras de la torre que presentaron fechas cercanas a 1918, sean parte del proceso tardío de construcción de la iglesia o de una restauración posterior. Por su parte, Ichuac fue construida a finales del siglo XIX, por lo que las piezas del piso que dataron entre 19201929, formarían parte de una posible restauración no descrita previamente en archivos históricos, la cual pudo ocurrir incluso varios años posterior a la fecha del anillo más reciente encontrado en las piezas estudiadas. Se concluye que P. uviferum tiene alto potencial para estudios históricos en estructuras patrimoniales en el sur de Chile.

AB  - This perspective paper reviews progress made in the last decades to enhance the communication and use of climate information relevant to the political and economic decision process. It focuses, specifically, on the creation and development of climate services, and highlights a number of difficulties that have limited the success of these services. Among them are the insufficient awareness by societal actors of their vulnerability to climate change, the lack of relevant products and services offered by the scientific community, the inappropriate format in which the information is provided, and the inadequate business model adopted by climate services. The authors suggest that, to be effective, centers should host within the same center a diversity of staff including experts in climate science, specialists in impact, adaptation and vulnerability, representatives of the corporate world, agents of the public service as well as social managers and communication specialists. The role and importance of environmental engineering is emphasized.

AB  - Archaeological and palaeoecological studies throughout the Americas have documented widespread landscape and environmental transformation during the pre-Columbian era. The highly dynamic Formative (or Neolithic) period in northern Chile (ca. 3700–1550 yr BP) brought about the local establishment of agriculture, introduction of new crops (maize, quinoa, manioc, beans, etc.) along with a major population increase, new emergent villages and technological innovations. Even trees such as the Algarrobos (Prosopis section Algarobia) may have been part of this transformation. Here, we provide evidence that these species were not native to the Atacama Desert of Chile (18–27S), appearing only in the late Holocene and most likely due to human actions. We assembled a database composed of 41 taxon specific AMS radiocarbon dates from archaeobotanical and palaeoecological records (rodent middens, leaf litter deposits), as well an extensive bibliographical review comprising archaeobotanical, paleoecological, phylogenetic and taxonomic data to evaluate the chronology of introduction and dispersal of these trees. Although Algarrobos could have appeared as early as 4200 yr BP in northernmost Chile, they only became common throughout the Atacama over a thousand years later, during and after the Formative period. Cultural and natural factors likely contributed to its spread and consolidation as a major silvicultural resource.

AB  - Understanding how human societies interacted with environmental changes is a major goal of archaeology and other socio-natural sciences. In this paper, we assess the human-environment interactions in the Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT) basin of the Atacama Desert over the last 13,000 years. By relying on a socio-environmental model that integrates ecosystem services with adaptive strategies, we review past climate changes, shifting environmental conditions, and the continuities and discontinuities in the nature and intensity of the human occupation of the PDT. As a result we highlight the importance of certain key resources such as water, an essential factor in the long-term trajectory of eco-historical change. Without water the outcome of human societies becomes hazardous.

AB  - Post-fire recruitment by seeds is regarded as an adaptive response in fire-prone ecosystems. Nevertheless, little is known about which heritable seed traits are functional to the main signals of fire (heat and smoke), thus having the potential to evolve. Here, we explored whether three seed traits (pubescence, dormancy and shape) and fire regime modulate seed response to fire cues(heat and smoke). As a model study system, we used  Helenium aromaticum  (Asteraceae), a native annual forb from the Chilean matorral, where fires are anthropogenic. We related seed trait values with fitness responses (germination and survival) after exposure to heat-shock and smoke experimental treatments on seeds from 10  H .  aromaticum  wild populations. We performed a phenotypic selection experiment to examine the relationship of seed traits with post-treatment fitness within a population (adaptive hypothesis). We then explored whether fire frequency in natural habitats was associated with trait expression across populations, and with germination and survival responses to experimental fire-cues. We found that populations subjected to higher fire frequency had, in average, more rounded and pubescent seeds than populations from rarely burned areas. Populations with more rounded and pubescent seeds were more resistant to 80°C heat-shock and smoke treatments.There was correlated selection on seed traits: pubescent-rounded or glabrouscent-elongated seeds had the highest probability of germinating after heat-shock treatments. Seed pubescence and shape in  H .  aromaticum  are heritable traits that modulate adaptive responses to fire. Our results provide new insights into the process of plant adaptation to fire and highlight the relevance of human-made fires as a strong evolutionary agent in the Anthropocene.

AB  - On January 4, 2014, during the summer period in South America, an intense forest and dry pasture wildfire occurred nearby the city of Santiago de Chile. On that day the biomass-burning plume was transported by low-intensity winds towards the metropolitan area of Santiago and impacted the concentration of pollutants in this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) is implemented to investigate the biomass-burning plume associated with these wildfires nearby Santiago, which impacted the ground-level ozone concentration and exacerbated Santiago's air quality. Meteorological variables simulated by WRF/Chem are compared against surface and radiosonde observations, and the results show that the model reproduces fairly well the observed wind speed, wind direction air temperature and relative humidity for the case studied. Based on an analysis of the transport of an inert tracer released over the locations, and at the time the wildfires were captured by the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the model reproduced reasonably well the transport of biomass burning plume towards the city of Santiago de Chile within a time delay of two hours as observed in ceilometer data. A six day air quality simulation was performed: the first three days were used to validate the anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, and the last three days (during and after the wildfire event) to analyze the performance of WRF/Chem plume-rise model within FINNv1 fire emission estimations. The model presented a satisfactory performance on the first days of the simulation when contrasted against data from the well-established air quality network over the city of Santiago de Chile. These days represent the urban air quality base case for Santiago de Chile unimpacted by fire emissions. However, for the last three simulation days, which were impacted by the fire emissions, the statistical indices showed a decrease in the model performance. While the model showed a satisfactory evidence that wildfires plumes that originated in the vicinity of Santiago de Chile were transported towards the urban area and impacted the air quality, the model still underpredicted some pollutants substantially, likely due to misrepresentation of fire emission sources during those days. Potential uncertainties may include to the land use/land cover classifications and its characteristics, such as type and density of vegetation assigned to the region, where the fire spots are detected. The variability of the ecosystem type during the fire event might also play a role.

AB  - The iconic conifer Araucaria araucana (Araucaria), called Pehuén by native people, is an endemic species of the Andes of northern Patagonia in Chile and Argentina. Its range encompasses only three degrees of latitude (37 ◦ 20 – 40 ◦ 20 S) with a small outlying presence in the coastal mountains of Chile (Veblen et al. 1995). The species is classified as endangered (Premoli et al. 2013) because of extensive logging and human-set fires. 
Araucaria araucana has a long history of ethnobiological importance. For centuries the Pehuén fruits have been a vital sustainable food source for the Pehuenche people (Mapuche) and today the growing industry of ecotourism indirectly serves to protect these forests (Aagesen 1998; González et al. 2013). After a long history of human destruction of A. araucana forests, which reduced its range to half its original distribution, Chile and Argentina now legally protect this endangered species. These ecosystems continue to be threatened by logging, fires, and extensive livestock use. These factors, and the potential threats posed by climate change, are among the main challenges to A. araucana conservation (González and Lara 2015).

AB  - Fire is a selective agent shaping plant traits and community assembly in fire-prone ecosystems. However, in ecosystems with no fire history, it can be a cause of land degradation when it is suddenly introduced by humans, as plant species may not be able to respond to such novel disturbance. Unlike other Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the world, natural fires have not been frequent during the Quaternary in the matorral of Central Chile, and thus, plant adaptive responses are expected to be uncommon. We evaluated the effect of heat shock on seed survival and germination of 21 native woody plants of the Chilean matorral and compiled information on smoke-stimulation and resprouting, to evaluate the importance of fire-adaptive responses in the context of the other MTE. We found that in the Chilean woody flora negative seed responses to fire cues were more frequent than positive responses. Although resprouting is a relatively widespread trait, fire-stimulated germination is not as common in the Chilean matorral as in other MTE. The seeds of seven endemic species were strongly damaged by fire cues and this should be considered in post-fire restoration planning. However, our results also showed that many species were resistant to elevated doses of heat shock and in some, germination was even stimulated. Thus, future research should focus on the evolutionary causes of these responses. These findings could help to develop strategies for fire management in the Chilean matorral. In addition, they will improve our understanding of the evolutionary forces that shaped this plant community and to better frame this region among the other MTE worldwide.

AB  - A method to predict vascular plant richness using spectral and textural variables in a heterogeneous wetland is presented. Plant richness was measured at 44 sampling plots in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland. Several spectral indices, first-order statistics (median and standard deviation), and second-order statistics [metrics of a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)] were extracted from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image and a Pleiades 1B image. We selected the most important variables for predicting richness using recursive feature elimination and then built a model using random forest regression. The final model was based on only two textural variables obtained from the GLCM and derived from the Landsat 8 image. An accurate predictive capability was reported ( R2=0.6; [Formula: see text]), highlighting the possibility of obtaining parsimonious models using textural variables. In addition, the results showed that the mid-resolution Landsat 8 image provided better predictors of richness than the high-resolution Pleiades image. This is the first study to generate a model for plant richness in a wetland ecosystem.

AB  - Considering the role that higher education institutions (HEIs) play in terms of catalysing change within societies, over the past years, sustainability initiatives within HEIs have flourished worldwide. Likewise, the scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change has been on the political and academic agenda for decades, thus, the importance of ameliorating climate change education and literacy both at the society and university training levels. Accordingly, certain questions arise: What are the most effective current climate change educational methodologies? Which road map would be the most appropriate to be suggested to HEIs to promote climate change literacy for future professionals? In order to begin addressing these questions, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences of the University of Chile (FCFM) approach to climate change teaching and literacy is herein described. The later contemplates the history of the institutionalisation of sustainability at the FCFM, collection of courses and minors for students which incorporate climate change related-topics, as well as climate change related research centres. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The age of organic material discharged by rivers provides information about its sources and carbon cycling processes within watersheds. Although elevated ages in fluvially transported organic matter are usually explained by erosion of soils and sedimentary deposits, it is commonly assumed that mainly young organic material is discharged from flat tropical watersheds due to their extensive plant cover and rapid carbon turnover. Here we present compound-specific radiocarbon data of terrigenous organic fractions from a sedimentary archive offshore the Congo River, in conjunction with molecular markers for methane-producing land cover reflecting wetland extent. We find that the Congo River has been discharging aged organic matter for several thousand years, with apparently increasing ages from the mid- to the Late Holocene. This suggests that aged organic matter in modern samples is concealed by radiocarbon from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. By comparison to indicators for past rainfall changes we detect a systematic control of organic matter sequestration and release by continental hydrology, mediating temporary carbon storage in wetlands. As aridification also leads to exposure and rapid remineralization of large amounts of previously stored labile organic matter, we infer that this process may cause a profound direct climate feedback that is at present underestimated in carbon cycle assessments.

AB  - Peatlands are ecosystems of great relevance, because they have an important number of ecological functions that provide many services to mankind. However, studies focusing on plant diversity, addressed from the remote sensing perspective, are still scarce in these environments. In the present study, predictions of vascular plant richness and diversity were performed in three anthropogenic peatlands on Chiloé Island, Chile, using free satellite data from the sensors OLI, ASTER, and MSI. Also, we compared the suitability of these sensors using two modeling methods: random forest (RF) and the generalized linear model (GLM). As predictors for the empirical models, we used the spectral bands, vegetation indices and textural metrics. Variable importance was estimated using recursive feature elimination (RFE). Fourteen out of the 17 predictors chosen by RFE were textural metrics, demonstrating the importance of the spatial context to predict species richness and diversity. Non-significant differences were found between the algorithms; however, the GLM models often showed slightly better results than the RF. Predictions obtained by the different satellite sensors did not show significant differences; nevertheless, the best models were obtained with ASTER (richness: R2 = 0.62 and %RMSE = 17.2, diversity: R2 = 0.71 and %RMSE = 20.2, obtained with RF and GLM respectively), followed by OLI and MSI. Diversity obtained higher accuracies than richness; nonetheless, accurate predictions were achieved for both, demonstrating the potential of free satellite data for the prediction of relevant community characteristics in anthropogenic peatland ecosystems. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers are organisms that modify habitats and resource flows, they therefore could have a disproportionate impact on the diversity of ecological communities. Evidence suggests that trash basket epiphytes (TBE) can be considered ecosystem engineers of forest canopies, due to their relationship with arboreal soil availability and treetop communities. Here we evaluated whether the TBE Fascicularia bicolor (Bromeliaceae), modulates temperature and humidity in the forest canopy. We also investigated if this bromeliad is related with greater arboreal soil accumulation and is associated to higher diversity of other epiphytic plants and invertebrates in the canopy of the South-American temperate rainforest (SATR), in Chile. We measured temperature and humidity in ten trees within the forest before and after the experimental addition of F. bicolor. We also related the presence of F. bicolor with occurrence of soil macrofauna and other canopy dwelling plants in a comparative field survey. Temperature variability in the canopy was reduced by F. bicolor. Soil availability was higher in siteswith mats of F. bicolor. The richness of vascular epiphytes was unaltered by the presence of F. bicolor,but species composition differed between sites with and without mats on each tree. At the group level,the cover of lichens and bryophytes was greater in sites without F. bicolor, while vascular epiphytes showa larger cover in sites with F. bicolor. The species richness of invertebrates increased in treetop sites colonized by F. bicolor but species composition was not different from soil in branch bifurcations. Our resultsshow that F. bicolor must be considered in forest management practices to determine which trees must belogged, in order to preserve the viability of populations of these key organisms in the treetops of South-American temperate rainforests.

AB  - The high Andes of western South America feature extreme ecological conditions that impose important physiological constraints on humans including high-elevation hypoxia and cold stress. This leads to questions regarding how these environments were colonized by the first waves of humans that reached them during the late Pleistocene. Based on previous research, and aided by 
human behavioral ecology principles, we assess hunter-gatherer behavioral strategies in the Andean highlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Specifically, we formulate three mobility strategies and their archaeological expectations and test these using technological and subsistence evidence from the six earliest well-dated highland sites in northern Chile. Our results 
suggest that all of the studied sites were temporarily occupied for hunting, processing animals, and toolkit maintenance. The sites also exhibit shared technological features within a curatorial strategy albeit with different occupation intensities. From this evidence, we infer that the initial occupations 
of the highlands were logistical and probably facilitated by increased local resource availability during a period of environmental amelioration.

AB  - In the framework of the World Meteorological Organisation's Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System, we evaluated the predictions of five state-of-the-art dust forecast models during an intense Saharan dust outbreak affecting western and northern Europe in April 2011. We assessed the capacity of the models to predict the evolution of the dust cloud with lead times of up to 72 h using observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and dust surface concentrations from a ground-based measurement network. In addition, the predicted vertical dust distribution was evaluated with vertical extinction profiles from the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). To assess the diversity in forecast capability among the models, the analysis was extended to wind field (both surface and profile), synoptic conditions, emissions and deposition fluxes. Models predict the onset and evolution of the AOD for all analysed lead times. On average, differences among the models are larger than differences among lead times for each individual model. In spite of large differences in emission and deposition, the models present comparable skill for AOD. In general, models are better in predicting AOD than near-surface dust concentration over the Iberian Peninsula. Models tend to underestimate the long-range transport towards northern Europe. Our analysis suggests that this is partly due to difficulties in simulating the vertical distribution dust and horizontal wind. Differences in the size distribution and wet scavenging efficiency may also account for model diversity in long-range transport.

TI  - Orographic Precipitation in Coastal Southern Chile: Mean Distribution, Temporal Variability, and Linear Contribution
AU  - Garreaud, R.

T2  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
AB  - The Nahuelbuta Mountains (NM) are a semielliptical massif 1300 m high in coastal southern Chile (37°–38°S) facing frontal storms that move from the Pacific. Mean precipitation between 900 and 1200 mm yr−1 is observed in the surrounding lowland, but river flow measurements suggest values ≥3000 mm yr−1 atop the mountains. To verify and characterize such marked orographic enhancement, 15 rain gauges were deployed around and over the NM. The observations were supplemented by a high-resolution WRF simulation and linear theory (LT) modeling during the winter of 2011. The estimated mean precipitation increases gradually from offshore (~1000 mm yr−1) to the north-facing foothills (2000 mm yr−1). The precipitation rapidly increases in the upslope sector to reach ~4000 mm yr−1 over the northern half of the NM elevated plateau, and decreases farther south to reach background values 20–30 km downstream of the mountains. The upstream (downstream) orographic enhancement (suppression) was relatively uniform among storms when considering event accumulations but varied substantially within each storm, with larger modifications during pre- and postfrontal stages and minor modifications during the brief but intense frontal passage. WRF results are in good agreement with observations in terms of seasonal and daily mean rainfall distributions, as well as temporal variability. Given its linear, steady-state formulation, the LT model cannot resolve rainfall variability at short (hourly) time scales, which in WRF is at least characterized by transient, mesoscale rainbands. Nonetheless, the rainbands are mobile so the accumulation field at monthly or longer time scales produced by the linear model is remarkably similar to its WRF counterpart.

TI  - Mitigation of Drought Negative Effect on Ecosystem Productivity by Vegetation Mixing
AU  - Van den Hoof, Catherine

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences
AB  - Vegetation diversity and interaction is thought to have a beneficial effect on ecosystem functioning, particularly improving ecosystem resistance to drought. This is of significant importance in the context of a warmer world, as extreme events such as droughts become more likely. Most of the studies performed so far on vegetation interaction are based on observations. Here we use the land surface model JULES to study the potential of vegetation mixing to mitigate the negative effect of drought events on the land surface through interaction, a mechanism which is difficult to study in situ at large scales. Using a set of simulations with mixed and unmixed vegetation, we show that the carbon, water, and energy fluxes are significantly affected by vegetation competition for water resources. The interaction is in general beneficial for the ecosystem carbon assimilation due to a better use of water resources. This benefit is highest when traits between vegetation types concerning resource competition overlap least. For a tree-grass combination, mixing improves carbon assimilation by 5% to 8% during summer. The NPP benefit of mixing increases further under progressively more resource-limited conditions up to an inflection point with a benefit of 14%, after which it falls back to zero under extremely dry conditions. Mixing also tends to reduce the inter-annual variability of the ecosystem carbon sink and therefore improves the resistance of the ecosystem. Our results highlight the importance of vegetation interaction in climate simulations and impact studies, and the potential of vegetation mixing as a mitigation tool.

AB  - Future global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will depend on climate feedbacks, the effect of which is expressed by climate sensitivity, the warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content. It is not clear how feedbacks, sensitivity, and temperature will evolve in our warming world, but past warming events may provide insight. Here we employ paleoreconstructions and new climate-carbon model simulations in a novel framework to explore a wide scenario range for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) carbon release and global warming event 55.8 Ma ago, a possible future warming analogue. We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.3–5.6 to 3.7–6.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM. When taken together with Last Glacial Maximum and modern estimates, this result indicates climate sensitivity increase with global warming.

TI  - Wind waves climatology of the Southeast Pacific Ocean
AU  - Aguirre, C.

T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - The climatology of wind waves over the Southeast Pacific is analysed using a 32-year hindcast from the WaveWatch III model, complemented by satellite-derived significant wave height (SWH) and buoy measurements for validation. Using partitioned spectral data, a regional climatology of wind sea and swell parameters was constructed. In general, the simulated SWH shows a good agreement with satellite and in situ SWH measurements, although the model appears to have a spatially uniform bias of approximately 0.3 m. The spatial pattern of SWH is clearly influenced by the meridional variation of mean surface wind speed, where the stronger winds over the Southern Ocean play a significant role generating higher waves at higher latitudes. Nevertheless, regional features are observed in the annual variability of SWH, which are associated with the existence of atmospheric coastal low-level jets off the coast of Peru and central Chile. In particular, the seasonal variation of these synoptic scale jets shows a direct relationship with the annual variability of SWH and with the probability of occurrence of wind sea conditions. Off the coast of Peru at approximately 15 ∘ S the coastal low-level jet is strongest during austral winter, increasing the wind sea SWH. In contrast, off central Chile, there is an important increase of wind sea SWH during summer.  The seasonal variation of the wind sea component leads to a contrasting seasonal variation of the total SWH at these locations: off Peru the coastal jet amplifies the annual variability of SWH, while off Central Chile the annual variability of SWH is suppressed by the presence of the coastal jet. Although the general conclusions of this research are considered to be robust, we discuss the limitations of the spectral partitioning method used to distinguish wind sea and swell-sea states.

AB  - The soil carbon dynamics of southern hemisphere temperate rainforests have rarely been studied. Here, we report for the first time soil CO2 effluxes and their partitioning for medium-age and old-growth Fitzroya cupressoides forests growing under contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range and Andean Cordillera of southern Chile. Fitzroya is a high biomass and one of the longest lived species in the world. We characterized soil respiration patterns over almost 2 yr. Annual soil respiration was slightly higher in younger forests from the Coastal Range compared with Andean forests during the first studied year (6.37–6.66 vs. 5.06–6.14 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), and significantly higher during the second year mainly due to a warmer and drier summer (8.08–8.64 vs. 4.98–5.35 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1). Therefore, warmer and drier conditions, likely to become more common in this region under future climate change, were associated with significantly higher respiration in the shallow soils of the coast, but not in the Andes. A higher proportion of autotrophic respiration was found in the Coastal Range forest probably due to a much higher fine root biomass in this site. However, fine root productivity, an important contributor of belowground carbon fluxes, was a little lower (not significantly) in the coastal site (0.81 ± 0.60 vs. 1.50 ± 0.42 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), indicating a longer root residence time in forests from this area. Soil CO2 effluxes from these forests and their root productivity are at the lower end of values recorded for other mature and old-growth temperate wet forests worldwide. The intrinsic longevity and the particularly poor soils and rainy conditions where these forests grow may influence these facts. Interannual climate variability appears to be especially important for soil respiration in the Coastal Range due to the more Mediterranean climate influence and shallow, poor water retention soils in this area.

AB  - Stretching over 4300 km north to south, Chile is a special country with complicated landscapes and rich biodiversity. Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate on the growth of trees is important to project the response of forests to climate change. Dendrochronological analysis offers a “proxy” source for the effects of climatic variation on tree growth at different spatial and temporal scales. To examine influences of temperature and precipitation on radial growth of Pinus pseudostrobus and Abies religiosa, this study combines measurements of radial growth patterns of forest trees in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in central Mexico with temperature and precipitation variables from instrumental records. Dendrochronological samples were collected as cross sections and increment cores by using a chainsaw and increment borers, respectively. Total ring-width chronologies were developed for each site. Principal component analyses (PCA) were used to identify common temperature, precipitation and tree growth variation patterns. Correlation and response function analyses between chronologies and records of temperature and precipitation were used to evaluate the relation of climate variables on tree growth. The months during which tree growth was most strongly affected by precipitation were January, February and October from the previous year; only the temperature of September from the previous year affected the tree growth. In some chronologies, May’s average monthly maximum temperature was negatively correlated with tree growth. PCA and a comparison of PCA factor scores of climatic variables and chronologies showed no significant differences between northern, central or southern portions of the MBBR. Apparently, tree growth in the MBBR is reduced in years of low January–May precipitation combined with high summer (September of the previous year) temperatures, a scenario which is likely to occur as a consequence of global climate change.

AB  - The identification of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3–N) origin is important in the control of surface and ground water quality. These are the main sources of available drinking water. Stable isotopes (15N and 18O) for NO3–N and along with a 1-D reactive transport model were used to study the origin and processes that lead to nitrogen transformation and loss in a major stream that flows into a reservoir within an intensively cultivated catchment area (352 km2) in Alentejo-Portugal. Seasonal water samples (October–November 2008, March 2009 and September 2009) of stream surface water, wells and sediment pore water were collected. The results showed consistently increasing isotope values and decreasing NO3–N concentrations downstream. During winter (wet period, November 2008 and March 2009) slightly higher NO3–N concentrations were found in comparison to early fall (dry period: October 2008) and summer (dry period: September 2009). Isotopic composition of 15N and 18O values in surface water samples from the stream and wells indicated that the dominant NO3–N sources were derived mainly from the soil and fertilizers. There was also significant nitrification in surface water at the head of the stream. Sediment pore waters showed high NO3–N values near the sediment-water interface (reaching 25 mg·N·L−1) and NO3–N concentrations sharply decreasing with sediment depth, suggesting significant NO3–N consumption. Denitrification was also detected using the 15N signature in upstream waters, but not downstream where very low NO3–N levels were measured. In the stream, the calculated isotopic enrichment factor for NO3–N was −2.9‰ for 15N and −1.78 for 18O, this indicates that denitrification accounts for 7.8% to 48% of nitrate removal.

AB  - During the last deglaciation, the opposing patterns of atmospheric CO2 and radiocarbon activities (Δ14C) suggest the release of 14C-depleted CO2 from old carbon reservoirs. Although evidences point to the deep Pacific as a major reservoir of this 14C-depleted carbon, its extent and evolution still need to be constrained. Here we use sediment cores retrieved along a South Pacific transect to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of Δ14C over the last 30,000 years. In ~2,500–3,600 m water depth, we find 14C-depleted deep waters with a maximum glacial offset to atmospheric 14C (ΔΔ14C=−1,000‰). Using a box model, we test the hypothesis that these low values might have been caused by an interaction of aging and hydrothermal CO2 influx. We observe a rejuvenation of circumpolar deep waters synchronous and potentially contributing to the initial deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2. These findings constrain parts of the glacial carbon pool to the deep South Pacific.

AB  - Ozone (O3) soundings have been performed on Easter Island or Rapa Nui (27 °S, 109 °W, 51 m a.s.l.) since 1994 as part of the Global Atmospheric Watch Programme of the World Meteorological Organization. In this work, we analyse 260 soundings compiled over the period 1994–2014, and make the data available for the international community. We characterise O3 profiles over this remote area of the Pacific by means of statistical analyses that consider, on the one hand, a traditional climatology that describes the data in terms of seasonal cycles based on monthly averages and, on the other hand, a process-oriented analysis based on self-organising maps. Our analyses show the influence of both tropical and subtropical/mid-latitude air masses at Rapa Nui. The former occurs in summer and fall when convective conditions prevail, and the latter in late winter and spring when subsiding conditions are recurrent. The occurrence of stratospheric intrusions in late winter and spring in connection with deep troughs and the presence of the subtropical jet stream is also apparent in the data set. The tropospheric ozone column is in good agreement with the corresponding data derived from satellites but with a systematic overestimate of summer and fall values. There is evidence of an upward trend in ozone near the surface, which suggests the impact of local pollution. We look forward to an enhancement of the Rapa Nui observing site, given its location that offers a privileged position to observe climate change over the sparsely sampled and vast South Pacific Ocean.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the capabilities of soil water balance modeling to estimate ET for very different conditions of rainfed grapevine water status, within a vineyard landscape that depicts heterogeneities in canopy, soil and water table conditions. We calibrated the HYDRUS-1D model against measurements of the soil moisture profile within seven contrasted sites, we validated HYDRUS-1D simulations against ET estimates derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements within two contrasted sites, and we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the HYDRUS-1D ET simulations throughout almost two growth cycles for the seven sites. The calibration of HYDRUS-1D was correctly achieved, with a relative RMSE of 20% on average. Validation of HYDRUS-1D simulations against EC measurements was satisfactory, with RMSE values of about 40 W m−2 at the hourly timescale and 0.5 mm d−1 at the daily timescale. HYDRUS-1D was able to provide consistent time series of ET within the seven contrasted sites and throughout the two growth cycles. We conclude that HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used as an alternative to EC measurements within rainfed vineyards, to alleviate experimental efforts for device cost and maintenance. Further, HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used for characterizing spatial variabilities and temporal dynamics, assessing impact of pedological conditions and land use on ET, or validating remote sensing retrievals over regional extents.

AB  - The concentration of greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and compounds such as total dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPt), along with other oceanographic variables were measured in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean within the Eurasian Basin (EAB). The EAB is affected by the perennial ice-pack and has seasonal microalgal blooms, which in turn may stimulate microbes involved in trace gas cycling. Data collection was carried out on board the LOMROG III cruise during the boreal summer of 2012. Water samples were collected from the surface to the bottom layer (reaching 4300 m depth) along a South-North transect (SNT), from 82.19°N, 8.75°E to 89.26°N, 58.84°W, crossing the EAB through the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. The Polar Mixed Layer and halocline waters along the SNT showed a heterogeneous distribution of N2O, CH4 and DMSPt, fluctuating between 42-111 and 27–649% saturation for N2O and CH4, respectively; and from 3.5 to 58.9 nmol L−1 for DMSPt. Spatial patterns revealed that while CH4 and DMSPt peaked in the Nansen Basin, N2O was higher in the Amundsen Basin. In the Atlantic Intermediate Water and Arctic Deep Water N2O and CH4 distributions were also heterogeneous with saturations between 52% and 106% and 28% and 340%, respectively. Remarkably, the Amundsen Basin contained less CH4 than the Nansen Basin and while both basins were mostly under-saturated in N2O. We propose that part of the CH4 and N2O may be microbiologically consumed via methanotrophy, denitrification, or even diazotrophy, as intermediate and deep waters move throughout EAB associated with the overturning water mass circulation. This study contributes to baseline information on gas distribution in a region that is increasingly subject to rapid environmental changes, and that has an important role on global ocean circulation and climate regulation.

T2  - Monthly Weather Review
AB  - Northern Chile hosts the driest place on Earth in the Atacama Desert. Nonetheless, an extreme precipitation event affected the region on 24-26 March 2015 with 1-day accumulated precipitation exceeding 40 mm in several locations and hourly mean rainfall rates higher than 10 mm h−1, producing floods and resulting in casualties and significant damage. The event is analyzed using ERA-Interim reanalysis, surface station data, sounding observations and satellite based radar. Two main conditions favorable for precipitation were present at the time of the event: (i) a cut-off low (COL) off the coast of Northern Chile and (ii) positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the eastern tropical Pacific. The circulation driven by the COL was strong but not extraordinary. A regional climate model (RegCM4) is used to test the sensitivity of precipitation to SST anomalies by removing the warm SST anomaly in the eastern tropical Pacific. The cooler simulation produced a very similar COL dry dynamics than that simulated in a control run (with observed SST), but, suppressed the precipitation by 60-80% over Northern Chile and 100% in parts of the Atacama Desert due to the decreased availability of precipitable water. The results indicate that the warm SST anomaly over eastern Pacific, favored by the onset of El Niño 2015-2016, was instrumental to the extreme precipitation event by providing an anomalous source of water vapor transported to Atacama by the circulation ahead of the COL.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are widely distributed primary producers with significant implications for the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria of subsection V (Order Stigonematales) are particularly ubiquitous in photoautotrophic microbial mats of hot springs. The Stigonematal cyanobacterium strain CHP1 isolated from the Porcelana hot spring (Chile) was one of the major contributors of the new nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Further morphological and genetic characterization verified that the strain CHP1 belongs to Stigonematales, and it formed a separate clade together with other thermophiles of the genera Fischerella and Mastigocladus. Strain CHP1 fixed maximum N2 in the light, independent of the temperature range. At 50 °C nifH gene transcripts showed high expression during the light period, whereas the nifH gene expression at 45 °C was arrhythmic. The strain displayed a high affinity for nitrate and a low tolerance for high ammonium concentrations, whereas the narB and glnA genes showed higher expression in light and at the beginning of the dark phase. It is proposed that Mastigocladus sp. strain CHP1 would represent a good model for the study of subsection V thermophilic cyanobacteria, and for understanding the adaptations of these photoautotrophic organisms inhabiting microbial mats in hot springs globally.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies are important, frequent, and persistent features of the circulation in the eastern South Pacific (ESP) Ocean, transporting physical, chemical and biological properties from the productive shelves to the open ocean. Some of these eddies exhibit subsurface hypoxic or suboxic conditions and may serve as important hotspots for nitrogen loss, but little is known about oxygen consumption rates and nitrogen transformation processes associated with these eddies. In the austral fall of 2011, during the Tara Oceans expedition, an intrathermocline, anticyclonic, mesoscale eddy with a suboxic (< 2 µmol kg−1 of O2), subsurface layer (200–400 m) was detected  ∼  900 km off the Chilean shore (30° S, 81° W). The core of the eddy's suboxic layer had a temperature-salinity signature characteristic of Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW) that at this latitude is normally restricted to an area near the coast. Measurements of nitrogen species within the eddy revealed undersaturation (below 44 %) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite accumulation (> 0.5 µM), suggesting that active denitrification occurred in this water mass. Using satellite altimetry, we were able to track the eddy back to its region of formation on the coast of central Chile (36.1° S, 74.6° W). Field studies conducted in Chilean shelf waters close to the time of eddy formation provided estimates of initial O2 and N2O concentrations of the ESSW source water in the eddy. By the time of its offshore sighting, concentrations of both O2 and N2O in the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eddy were lower than concentrations in surrounding water and “source water” on the shelf, indicating that these chemical species were consumed as the eddy moved offshore. Estimates of apparent oxygen utilization rates at the OMZ of the eddy ranged from 0.29 to 44 nmol L−1 d−1 and the rate of N2O consumption was 3.92 nmol L−1 d−1. These results show that mesoscale eddies affect open-ocean biogeochemistry in the ESP not only by transporting physical and chemical properties from the coast to the ocean interior but also during advection, local biological consumption of oxygen within an eddy further generates conditions favorable to denitrification and loss of fixed nitrogen from the system.

AB  - The climatology and recent trends of low-level coastal clouds at three sites along the northern Chilean coast (18.3°–23.4°S) are documented based upon up to 45 years of hourly observations of cloud type, coverage, and heights. Consistent with the subtropical location, cloud types are dominated by stratocumuli having greatest coverage (>7 oktas) and smaller heights (600–750 m) during the nighttime of austral winter and spring. Meridionally, nighttime cloud fraction and cloud-base heights increase from south to north. Long-term trends in mean cloud cover are observed at all sites albeit with a seasonal modulation, with increasing (decreasing) coverage in the spring (fall). Consistent trend patterns are also observed in independent sunshine hour measurements at the same sites. Cloud heights show negative trends of about 100 m decade−1 (1995–2010), although the onset time of this tendency differs between sites. The positive cloud fraction trends during the cloudy season reported here disagree with previous studies, with discrepancies attributed to differences in datasets used or to methodological differences in data analysis. The cloud-base height tendency, together with a less rapid lowering of the subsidence inversion base height, suggests a deepening of the coastal cloud layer. While consistent with the tendency toward greater low-level cloud cover and the known cooling of the marine boundary layer in this region, these tendencies are at odds with a drying trend of the near-surface air documented here as well. Assessing whether this intriguing result is caused by physical factors or by limitations of the data demands more detailed observations, some of which are currently under way.

T2  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
AB  - Identifying the key anthropogenic (land uses) and natural (topography and climate) biophysical drivers affecting river water quality is essential for efficient management of water resources. We tested the hypothesis that water quality can be predicted by different biophysical factors. Multivariate statistics based on a geographical information system (GIS) were used to explore the influence of factors (i.e., precipitation, topography, and land uses) on water quality (i.e., nitrate (NO 3 − ), phosphate (PO 4 3 − ), silicate (Si(OH)4), dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (TSS), biological oxygen demand (DO), temperature (T), conductivity (EC), and pH) for two consecutive years in the Itata and Biobío river watersheds, Central Chile (36° 00′ and 38° 30′). The results showed that (NO 3 − ), (PO 4 3 − ), Si(OH)4, TSS, EC, and DO were higher during rainy season (austral fall, winter, and spring), whereas BOD and temperature were higher during dry season. The spatial variation of these parameters in both watersheds was related to land use, topography (e.g., soil moisture, soil hydrological group, and erodability), and precipitation. Soil hydrological group and soil moisture were the strongest explanatory predictors for PO 4 3 − , Si(OH)4 and EC in the river, followed by land use such as agriculture for NO 3 − and DO and silviculture for TSS and Si(OH)4. High-resolution water leaching and runoff maps allowed us to identify agriculture areas with major probability of water leaching and higher probability of runoff in silviculture areas. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that land uses (agriculture and silviculture) explained in 60 % the river water quality variation. Our finding highlights the vulnerability of Chilean river waters to different biophysical drivers, rather than climate conditions alone, which is amplified by human-induced degradation.

AB  - The understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns in land use and land cover (LULC) change is a key issue for conservation efforts. In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970–1990 period. This decreased in the 1990–2000 period and rose again in the 2000–2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.

T2  - Biosystems
AB  - Fixed points are fundamental states in any dynamical system. In the case of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles associated to the various cell types. We use Kauffman's approach to model GRNs with random Boolean networks (RBNs). In this paper we explore how the topology affects the distribution of the number of fixed points in randomly generated networks. We also study the size of the basins of attraction of these fixed points if we assume the α-asynchronous dynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). It is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cyclic attractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We observe the remarkable property that, in all our simulations, if for a given RBN with Barabási–Albert topology and α-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a fixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast, in the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a fixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller. We contrast the results of the simulations on Barabási–Albert networks with the classical Erdös–Rényi model of random networks. Everything indicates that Barabási–Albert networks are extremely robust. Finally, we study the mean and maximum time/work needed to reach a fixed point when starting from randomly chosen initial configurations.

AB  - From 18 to 27 March 2015, northern, central, and southern Chile experienced a series of extreme hydrometeorological events. First, the highest surface air temperature ever recorded in Santiago (with reliable records dating to 1877), 36.8°C at Quinta Normal, was measured at 15:47 local time on 20 March 2015. Immediately following this high heat event, an extreme precipitation event, with damaging streamflows from precipitation totals greater than 45 mm, occurred in the semiarid and hyperarid Atacama regions. Finally, concurrent with the heavy precipitation event, extremely warm temperatures were recorded throughout southern Chile. These events were examined from a synoptic perspective with the goal of identifying forcing mechanisms and potential interaction between each analysis which provides operational context by which to identify and predict similar events in the future. Primary findings were as follows: (1) record warm temperatures in central Chile resulted from anomalous lower troposphere ridging and easterly downslope flow, both of which developed in response to an anomalous midtroposphere ridge-trough pattern; (2) a cutoff low with anomalous heights near one standard deviation below normal slowly moved east and was steered ashore near 25°S by circulation around a very strong ridge (anomalies more than 3 standard deviations above normal) centered near 60°S; (3) anomalously high precipitable water content (20 mm above climatological norms) over the Peruvian Bight region was advected southward and eastward ahead of the cutoff low by low-level northwesterly flow, greatly enhancing observed precipitation over northern Chile.

AB  - Knowledge of the contribution that individual countries have made to global radiative forcing is important to the implementation of the agreement on “common but differentiated responsibilities” reached by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Over the past three decades, China has experienced rapid economic development, accompanied by increased emission of greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and aerosols, but the magnitude of the associated radiative forcing has remained unclear. Here we use a global coupled biogeochemistry–climate model and a chemistry and transport model to quantify China’s present-day contribution to global radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases, short-lived atmospheric climate forcers and land-use-induced regional surface albedo changes. We find that China contributes 10% ± 4% of the current global radiative forcing. China’s relative contribution to the positive (warming) component of global radiative forcing, mainly induced by well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols, is 12% ± 2%. Its relative contribution to the negative (cooling) component is 15% ± 6%, dominated by the effect of sulfate and nitrate aerosols. China’s strongest contributions are 0.16 ± 0.02 watts per square metre for CO2 from fossil fuel burning, 0.13 ± 0.05 watts per square metre for CH4, −0.11 ± 0.05 watts per square metre for sulfate aerosols, and 0.09 ± 0.06 watts per square metre for black carbon aerosols. China’s eventual goal of improving air quality will result in changes in radiative forcing in the coming years: a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions would drive a faster future warming, unless offset by larger reductions of radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon.

AB  - Little dendroclimatic research has been conducted on species of Podocarpus, in response to inherent difficulties associated with tree-ring differentiation and cross-dating. We sampled complete stem cross sections from a plantation of Podocarpus salignus trees in Valdivia, Chile, near the southern edge of the species’ range. We measured earlywood, latewood, and total ring widths avoiding ring wedging, and we calculated the corresponding chronologies. The relationship of these chronologies with maximum temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure was addressed using correlation and redundancy analyses. All chronologies showed a similar response to climate that was consistent with the cloudy, rainy, and temperate conditions of the study area. That is, warm and dry conditions during previous late springs were beneficial, while warm and rainy winters under low atmospheric pressures were detrimental for growth. The observed climatic responses are in contrast to those of conifers from mountainous areas of southern South America. Limitation of carbohydrates available for growth in the following active season was a possible cause for the observed responses to climate. That is, high winter temperatures may deplete stored carbohydrates by increasing respiration, and a high degree of cloud cover reduces the radiation received by the trees in the active season, which may hamper photosynthesis. Our work highlights the dendroclimatological value of Podocarpus salignus to investigate the influence of climatic variation on tree growth and forest productivity. © 2016 Polska Akademia Nauk.

AB  - The online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was applied to simulate a haze event that happened in January 2010 in the North China Plain (NCP), and was validated against various types of measurements. The evaluations indicate that WRFChem provides reliable simulations for the 2010 haze event in the NCP. This haze event was mainly caused by high emissions of air pollutants in the NCP and stable weather conditions in winter. Secondary inorganic aerosols also played an important role and cloud chemistry had important contributions. Air pollutants outside Beijing contributed about 64.5% to the PM2.5 levels in Beijing during this haze event, and most of them are from south Hebei, Tianjin city, Shandong and Henan provinces. In addition, aerosol feedback has important impacts on surface temperature, relative humidity (RH) and wind speeds, and these meteorological variables affect aerosol distribution and formation in turn. In Shijiazhuang, Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) decreased about 278.2m and PM2.5 increased more than 20 μgm-3 due to aerosol feedback. It was also shown that black carbon (BC) absorption has significant impacts on meteorology and air quality changes, indicating more attention should be paid to BC from both air pollution control and climate change perspectives.

AB  - This paper presents the first systematic investigation of stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) from the subfossil chironomid head capsules (HCs) of a single taxon (Chironomus). The study focuses on sixteen south-eastern Australian lakes and investigates the potential of Chironomus spp. HC stable isotopes to reconstruct past temperature changes from these lakes. The relationship between δ18O values of Chironomus spp. HCs from Australian oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes in humid areas and air temperature appears robust (r = 0.88) and in line with results from European lakes. Similar results were obtained for δ2H values and temperature (r = 0.94). For lakes that are located in semi-arid and sub-humid areas that have high evaporation compared to precipitation, and often long water residence time, the temperature relationship is not robust. This is due to the evaporative enrichment of δ18O values in lake water and the effect of salinity and higher nutrient status. Vital effects may also play a role. The overall findings of this study are that both Chironomus spp. HC δ18O and δ2H are potentially valuable tools for reconstructing temperature in cooler, low nutrient and low salinity lakes of Australia. In warmer, sub-humid to semi-arid regions, δ18O and δ2H may provide valuable information about past changes in hydrological conditions.

AB  - The improvement of solar thermal technologies in emerging economies like Chile is particularly attractive because the country is endowed with one of the most consistently high solar potentials, lithium and copper reserves. In recent years, growing interests for lithium based salts and copper foams in application of thermal technologies could change the landscape of Chile transforming its lithium reserves and copper availability into competitive energy produced in the region. This study reviews the technical advantages of using lithium based salts—applied as heat storage media and heat transfer fluid—and copper foam/Phase Change Materials (PCM) alternatives—applied as heat storage media—within tower and parabolic trough Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, and presents a first systematic evaluation of the costs of these alternatives based on real plant data. The methodology applied is based on material data base compilation of price and technical properties, selection of CSP plant and estimation of amount of required material, and analysis of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Results confirm that some lithium based salts are effective in reducing the amount of required material and costs for the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems for both plant cases, with savings of up to 68% and 4.14% in tons of salts and LCOE, respectively. Copper foam/PCM composites significantly increase thermal conductivity, decreasing the volume of the TES system, but costs of implementation are still higher than traditional options.

AB  - The winter haze is a growing problem in North China, but the causes are not well understood. The chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Chem) was applied in North China to examine how PM2.5 concentrations change in response to changes in emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), ammonia (NH3), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)), as well as meteorology (temperature, relative humidity (RH), and wind speeds) changes in winter. From 1960 to 2010, the dramatic changes in emissions lead to +260 % increases in sulfate, +320 % increases in nitrate, +300 % increases in ammonium, +160 % increases in BC, and +50 % increases in OC. The responses of PM2.5 to individual emission species indicate that the simultaneous increases in SO2, NH3, and NOx emissions dominated the increases in PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 shows more notable increases in response to changes in SO2 and NH3 as compared to increases in response to changes in NOx emissions. In addition, OC also accounts for a large fraction in PM2.5 changes. These results provide some implications for haze pollution control. The responses of PM2.5 concentrations to temperature increases are dominated by changes in wind fields and mixing heights. PM2.5 shows relatively smaller changes in response to temperature increases and RH decreases compared to changes in response to changes in wind speed and aerosol feedbacks. From 1960 to 2010, aerosol feedbacks have been significantly enhanced due to higher aerosol loadings. The discussions in this study indicate that dramatic changes in emissions are the main cause of increasing haze events in North China, and long-term trends in atmospheric circulations may be another important cause since PM2.5 is shown to be substantially affected by wind speed and aerosol feedbacks. More studies are necessary to get a better understanding of the aerosol–circulation interactions.

AB  - South America lost around 52 genera of mammals during a worldwide event known as the Late Quaternary Extinction episode. More than 80% of South American mammals weighing > 44 kg succumbed. Analysis of the megafaunal extinction chronology in relation to human arrival and major climate changes have revealed slightly different extinction patterns in different eco-regions of the continent, highlighting the importance of detailed regional analysis in order to understand how the possible drivers of extinction operated. Here we present an analysis of the megafaunal extinction in the Última Esperanza (UE) area of southwestern Patagonia, Chile. We have compiled a comprehensive chronology of megafaunal extinctions and earliest human occupation between 18–7 cal ka BP, based on radiocarbon dates from published literature. We calculated confidence intervals using the GRIWM method to estimate the times of human arrival and megafaunal local extinctions, and then compared these events to the timing of major climate and vegetation changes, fire frequency increase, and the Reclús volcanic eruption. Our results suggest that a combination of human impacts and climate–vegetation change drove megafaunal extinctions in the UE area, with the balance of factors being taxon specific; the volcanic eruption does not seem to have exacerbated extinctions. Competition between humans and mega-carnivores seems to be the most plausible cause for the extinction of the mega-carnivores. Coexistence of humans with extinct horses, extinct camels, and mylodonts for several thousand years rules out a scenario of blitzkrieg overkill of megafauna by humans. The transition of vegetation from cold grasslands to Nothofagus forests corresponds with the disappearance of Hippidion saldiasi and Lama cf. owenii. The later full establishment of Nothofagus forests and an increasing fire frequency coincided with the disappearance of mylodonts. A climate-driven reduction of open environments plausibly reduced herbivore's populations making them susceptible to local extinction.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - This paper presents a general framework to estimate the bus user time benefits of a median busway including the effects on travel time and access time. Unlike previous models, we take into account the effects of geometry and the interaction with the demand structure. Models for predicting the bus in-vehicle time benefits of a median dual carriageway busway against mixed traffic condition on 2 and 3 lanes roads are estimated using data from a case study in Santiago (Chile), using a bus travel time model empirically estimated and considering different base case situations, including mixed traffic operations and bus lanes. Results of the application show that the expected in-vehicle time savings of a median busway might be reduced by access time losses due to increased walking distances and road crossing delays. Also, that net time benefits can vary significantly according to the base situation and the structure of demand considered. These findings point out to the need of including a wider set of impacts when studying the benefits of median busways, beyond in-vehicle time savings only. The empirical work presented here is completely based on passive data coming from GPS and smartcards, what makes easier and cheaper to conduct this type of analysis as well as to do it with a comprehensive scope at an early stage of the development of a BRT project. This framework can be extended to other types of dedicated bus lanes provided that a corresponding bus travel time savings model is available.

Four headwaters in Southern Africa.
Study focus
The streamflow regimes in Southern Africa are amongst the most variable in the world. The corresponding differences in streamflow bias and variability allowed us to analyze the behavior and robustness of the LISFLOOD hydrological model parameters. A differential split-sample test is used for calibration using seven satellite-based rainfall estimates, in order to assess the robustness of model parameters. Robust model parameters are of high importance when they have to be transferred both in time and space. For calibration, the modified Kling-Gupta statistic was used, which allowed us to differentiate the contribution of the correlation, bias and variability between the simulated and observed streamflow.
New hydrological insights
Results indicate large discrepancies in terms of the linear correlation (r), bias (β) and variability (γ) between the observed and simulated streamflows when using different precipitation estimates as model input. The best model performance was obtained with products which ingest gauge data for bias correction. However, catchment behavior was difficult to be captured using a single parameter set and to obtain a single robust parameter set for each catchment, which indicate that transposing model parameters should be carried out with caution. Model parameters depend on the precipitation characteristics of the calibration period and should therefore only be used in target periods with similar precipitation characteristics (wet/dry).

AB  - Late twentieth-century instrumental records reveal a persistent southward shift of the Southern Westerly Winds during austral summer and autumn associated with a positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and contemporaneous with glacial recession, steady increases in atmospheric temperatures and CO2 concentrations at a global scale. However, despite the clear importance of the SAM in the modern/future climate, very little is known regarding its behaviour during pre-Industrial times. Here we present a stratigraphic record from Lago Cipreses (51°S), southwestern Patagonia, that reveals recurrent ∼200-year long dry/warm phases over the last three millennia, which we interpret as positive SAM-like states. These correspond in timing with the Industrial revolution, the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly, the Roman and Late Bronze Age Warm Periods and alternate with cold/wet multi-centennial phases in European palaeoclimate records. We conclude that SAM-like changes at centennial timescales in southwestern Patagonia represent in-phase interhemispheric coupling of palaeoclimate over the last 3,000 years through atmospheric teleconnections.

AB  - On the basis of 8-years (2005-2012) of stroke data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network we describe the spatial distribution and temporal variability of lightning activity over Western Patagonia. This region extends from ∼40°S to 55°S along the west coast of South America, is limited to the east by the austral Andes, and features a hyper-humid, maritime climate. Stroke density exhibits a sharp maximum along the coast of southern Chile. Although precipitation there is largely produced by cold nimbostratus, days with more than one stroke occur up to a third of the time somewhere along the coastal strip. Disperse strokes are also observed off southern Chile. In contrast, strokes are virtually nonexistent over the austral Andes - where precipitation is maximum - and farther east over the dry lowlands of Argentina. Atmospheric reanalysis and satellite imagery are used to characterize the synoptic environment of lightning-producing storms, exemplified by a case study and generalized by a compositing analysis. Lightning activity tends to occur when Western Patagonia is immersed in a pool of cold air behind a front that has reached the coast at ∼40°S. Under these circumstances, midlevel cooling occurs before and is more prominent than near-surface cooling, leading to a weakly unstable postfrontal condition. Forced uplift of the strong westerlies impinging on the coastal mountains can trigger convection and produces significant lightning activity in this zone. Farther offshore, large-scale ascent near the cyclone's center may lift near-surface air parcels, fostering shallow convection and dispersing lightning activity. Key Points Significant lightning activity occurs in Western Patagonia Lightning storms develop under a cold, weakly unstable postfrontal condition Topography and ocean conditions favor lightning activity in Western Patagonia. © 2014.

AB  - The concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) and methane (CH<inf>4</inf>), were measured in the Kerguelen Plateau region (KPR). The KPR is affected by an annual microalgal bloom caused by natural iron fertilization, and this may stimulate the microbes involved in GHG cycling. This study was carried out during the KEOPS 2 cruise during the austral spring of 2011. Oceanographic variables, including N2O and CH4, were sampled (from the surface to 500 m depth) in two transects along and across the KRP, the north-south (TNS) transect (46°-51° S, ∼ 72° E) and the east-west (TEW) transect (66°-75° E, ∼ 48.3° S), both associated with the presence of a plateau, polar front (PF) and other mesoscale features. The TEW presented N<inf>2</inf>O levels ranging from equilibrium (105%) to slightly supersaturated (120%) with respect to the atmosphere, whereas CH<inf>4</inf> levels fluctuated dramatically, being highly supersaturated (120-970%) in areas close to the coastal waters of the Kerguelen Islands and in the PF. The TNS showed a more homogenous distribution for both gases, with N<inf>2</inf>O and CH<inf>4</inf> levels ranging from 88 to 171% and 45 to 666% saturation, respectively. Surface CH4 peaked at southeastern stations of the KPR (A3 stations), where a phytoplankton bloom was observed. Both gases responded significantly, but in contrasting ways (CH<inf>4</inf> accumulation and N<inf>2</inf>O depletion), to the patchy distribution of chlorophyll a. This seems to be associated to the supply of iron from various sources. Air-sea fluxes for N<inf>2</inf>O (from -10.5 to 8.65, mean 1.25 ± 4.04 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and for CH<inf>4</inf> (from 0.32 to 38.1, mean 10.01 ± 9.97 μmol<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) indicated that the KPR is both a sink and a source for N<inf>2</inf>O, as well as a considerable and variable source of CH<inf>4</inf>. This appears to be associated with biological factors, as well as the transport of water masses enriched with Fe and CH<inf>4</inf> from the coastal area of the Kerguelen Islands. These previously unreported results for the Southern Ocean suggest an intense microbial CH<inf>4</inf> production in the study area.

AB  - Coastal upwelling areas are highly productive marine systems in which the development of oxygen-depleted conditions and the availability of diverse electron donors (e.g., organic matter, NHz 4 ,H2S) favor the processes involved in nitrogen (N) loss. We characterize the temporal and vertical variability of anammox and denitrification over the continental shelf off central Chile (36.5°S), through 15N and 13C tracer experiments, including amendments with H2S and S2O2- 3 along with measurements of 15N2 and 15N2O production and oceanographic variables during a year (2009 to 2010). Restricted to the bottom waters, both anammox and denitrification contributed similarly (∼ 500 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) to N loss during spring, while a marked decrease in the activity of these processes occurred in summer (103 and 14 nmolN2 L-1 d-1 for anammox and denitrification, respectively). During fall, denitrification was the only contributor to the observed nitrogen deficit (894 nmol N2 L-1 d-1). Interestingly, a substantial increase in the rates of denitrification (∼ 1200 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) and dark 13C assimilation were observed after the addition of H2S, indicating an autotrophic contribution to denitrification, which could be fueled in situ by H2S emitted from sediments or produced in the water column. The observed patterns seem to be controlled (stimulated or inhibited) by the availability of oxygen, organic matter, andH2S. This study establishes the magnitude and co-occurrence of the different processes responsible for N removal in the coastal upwelling system of central Chile. This linkage of the nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles is relevant to a global climate change scenario.

AB  - Developing spatially resolved high-resolution datasets of robust long-term changes in human demography constitutes a major challenge for archaeology. One approach is to use the distribution of summed radiocarbon-age probabilities to infer long-term population dynamics (i.e. palaeodemography). However, these can often be biased by preservation potential, site taphonomy or researcher priorities among other aspects, all of which require large datasets to resolve adequately. For this report, we have created such a dataset for the South-Central Andes (16°-25°S), here termed the South Central Andes Radiocarbon (SCAR) database. SCAR spans the last 15,000 years and incorporates ∼1700 14C-dates from 519 archeological sites reported across an extreme bioclimatic gradient that includes the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert and adjacent cold, high-elevation Altiplano. Among the possible methodological biases, we first evaluated those related to calibration procedures. Otherwise, changes in summed probability curves show no other relevant biases except for possible research interest/priorities that could be responsible for the gaps in the record from the Bolivian altiplano. Our temporally continuous time-series indicates that prehispanic populations exhibited significant demographic changes during the last 13,100calBP. Except for coastal populations; most regions show strongly coordinated demographic fluctuations that follow the same major patterns. Thus, we identified two broad scale population events across the South-Central Andes (Atacama inland, Bolivian Altiplano) from 13,100-4000calBP and then from 4000calBP to the present. In contrast, the Atacama coastal records suggest a different and more variable occupation pattern over the last 13,460calBP, which could be driven by the interaction with oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling). A widespread major decline at 700calBP clearly predates the Spanish colonization and occurs in all of our regions. This widespread decline does not appear to be due to methodological biases, and suggests that a population crash occurred before European occupation. Overall, the SCAR database constitutes a valuable proxy for establishing the long-term dynamics of prehistoric societies that inhabited the western Andean slope. Time-series analyses that use SCAR will shed new light on the demographic and cultural dynamics at different spatial-scales, and help clarify the processes involved in the migrational trajectories and cultural evolution of the peoples that inhabited the South-Central Andes over the last 15,000 years.

AB  - Dust deposition in the Southern Ocean constitutes a critical modulator of past global climate variability, but how it has varied temporally and geographically is underdetermined. Here, we present data sets of glacial-interglacial dust-supply cycles from the largest Southern Ocean sector, the polar South Pacific, indicating three times higher dust deposition during glacial periods than during interglacials for the past million years. Although the most likely dust source for the South Pacific is Australia and New Zealand, the glacial-interglacial pattern and timing of lithogenic sediment deposition is similar to dust records from Antarctica and the South Atlantic dominated by Patagonian sources. These similarities imply large-scale common climate forcings, such as latitudinal shifts of the southern westerlies and regionally enhanced glaciogenic dust mobilization in New Zealand and Patagonia.

T2  - Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy
AB  - There is growing recognition that routine climate change framing is insufficient for addressing the challenges presented by this change, and that different framings of climate change shape stakeholders' practices and guide policy options. This research investigated how stakeholders conceptualise climate change in terms of its seriousness and related uncertainty, and a resilience approach as a possible policy option to confront this uncertainty. An application of the conceptual framework provided by Handmer and Dovers' typology of emergencies is novel to the climate change field. Results show that there is a tendency to frame climate change as complex (with uncertainty representing part of that complexity) and to confront this complexity with less complex policies and solutions. No pattern of a conceptual link between uncertainty and resilience was observed. The results presented in this study offer empirical evidence to inform theory and provide helpful insights to inform policy design and practice.

AB  - We have presented a descriptive analysis showing a suite of different global products that combine information from models and satellites to provide the global distribution of surface total solar radiation as well as the distribution of the main substances that explain the atmospheric extinction of solar radiation reaching the surface. Latitude, elevation, cloud fraction, water vapor, and aerosols have a first-order influence on the distribution of surface solar radiation over the planet, and no single factor explains the combined distribution. The most likely location of the total solar radiation over the surface of the planet is on the pre-Andean Domeyko Cordillera, a mountain range with elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 m. The regional climate of the Atacama is such that extremely low values of water vapor, cloud cover, ozone, and aerosols concur in this region. The atmospheric transparency in the visible and infrared provided by these conditions, together with a relatively high elevation and low latitude, conspire to produce a region where mean total radiation values exceed 300 W m-2. According to a semiempirical model for surface solar radiation that takes into account extinction by gases, clouds, aerosols, and the effect of topography, the maximum is about 310 ± 15 W m-2, although for individual years, especially those with dry summertime Altiplano conditions, the solar maximum should be located in the Altiplano region near to the Chajnantor Plateau. The delicate combination of elements that concurs in the Atacama region still justifies the increase in observational capabilities of solar radiation and atmospheric composition as it was first devised and executed by the pioneers of solar research in Mount Montezuma in the early twentieth century.

AB  - We report on an episode of extremely low precipitable water vapour (PWV) of approximately 0.1mm with a duration of more than 12 h at European Southern Observatory's Paranal observatory [2635m above sea level (asl)]. Such conditions are more commonly expected at sites at much higher altitude such as ALMA on the Chajnantor plateau (5000m asl) or otherwise particularly dry sites such as locations in Antarctica. We provide a full account ofthe measurements of PWV and other relevant atmospheric parameters. An explanation of the observed conditions is given in terms of the prevailing meteorological pattern. Based on statistical evidence from measurements by VLT spectrographs (UVES and CRIRES) covering more than a decade, we find that PWV <0.2mm can be expected on less than 1 per cent of the nights, while <0.5mm is encountered on 6-7 nights per year (≈2 per cent). The scientificpotential of using this small but significant fraction of observing time is illustrated in the context of service modeSociety. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - The concept of ecosystem services from landscapes is rapidly gaining momentum as a language to communicate values and benefits to scientists and lay alike. Landscape ecology has an enormous contribution to make to this field, and one could argue, uniquely so. Tools developed or adapted for landscape ecology are being increasingly used to assist with the quantification, modelling, mapping, and valuing of ecosystem services. Several of these tools and methods encased therein are described among the eleven papers presented in this special issue, and their application has the potential to facilitate the management and promotion of services within ecosystems. Papers are associated with each of the four key categories of services that ecosystems provide to humans: supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural. The papers represent work conducted in eleven different countries, especially from South America. Each carries a unique approach to address a particular question pertaining to a particular set of ecosystem services. These studies are designed to inform and improve the economic, environmental and social values of the ecosystem services. This knowledge should help to develop new management alternatives for sustaining and planning ecosystems and the services they provide at different scales in space and time. We believe that these papers will create interest and inform management of some potential methods to evaluate ecosystem services at the landscape level with an integrative approach, offering new tools for management and conservation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - The Valdivian rainforest ecoregion in Chile (35°-48°S) has a high conservation priority worldwide. These forests are also keys for social welfare as a result of their supply of timber as well as ecosystem services. Forests in the ecoregion have been extensively converted to fast growing Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. plantations for timber production promoted by public policies and timber companies. This study describes the results of detailed measurements of hydrology and stream water chemistry in eight small watersheds in south central Chile, subjected to replacement of native temperate rainforest by exotic Eucalyptus plantations. In this system, watersheds have streamside buffers of native forest (SNFW) with varying widths. Results indicate that retention of SNFW counteracts hydrologic effects of Eucalyptus plantations, which are widely known to reduce water yields. A 1.4% rate of increase of the run-off coefficient for each metre of increase of SNFW was observed. In addition, a decrease in the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), nitrate-N, and different sized fractions of particulate organic matter were found in streams draining these plantations as a function of increasing SNFW. Streamside buffer widths of 17-22m for total nitrogen and DIN concentrations and ≥36m for sediments were required to provide comparable values to reference watersheds (100% native forest). The findings from this study suggest that SNFW may significantly reduce adverse effects from exotic species forestry plantations on water provision in an area of south central Chile where exotic forest plantations are rapidly expanding. © 2015 John Wiley

AU  - Cornejo, Marcela

AU  - Farías, Laura
T2  - Progress in Oceanography
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a trace gas affecting atmospheric radiative forcing through its greenhouse effect in the troposphere and destroying the ozone in the stratosphere. The oceans account for one-third of the global atmospheric N2O emissions, in which they are primarily cycled by nitrification and denitrification, with high N2O production in the subsurface waters. The surface waters are generally reported to be in equilibrium or slightly supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. However, surface N2O sub-saturations have been observed in several regions of the world's oceans, such as off south-central Chile, which is bathed by the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), where N2O subsaturations as low as 35% have been registered during the austral spring and summer. An analysis of the mechanisms driving such surface N2O subsaturations (physical or biological) showed that physical mechanisms were not responsible for the high surface N2O deficit. In contrast, in situ potential experiments in surface waters with 15N2O addition showed an active biological N2O fixation (between 0.43 and 87.34nmol/L/d), with the highest N2O fixation rates associated with the SAAW (25.25-25.75kg/m3).Additionally, incubation experiments with 15N2O in surface water samples from one oceanic station showed high 15N-POM enrichment (0.44‰) and an inhibition of 15N-POM enrichment when an additional nitrogen source was added (NO2 - and NH4 +). These results suggest the existence of a mechanism able to use several nitrogen sources, including N2O. Molecular analyses (16S rRNA gene) from these experiments showed the presence of three major groups of bacteria: Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria and Cyanobacteria, with Synechococcus sp. being the dominant group in the culture. However, the analysis of the nifH gene showed a taxonomic affiliation to the order Stigonematales associated with Mastigocladus sp. and Fischerella sp. and the order Oscillatoriales associated with Trichodesmium sp.Finally, the oceanic region exhibiting surface N2O subsaturations acts as a sink for atmospheric N2O, consuming ∼11.4 Gg of N2O in a six-month period. The N2O levels in the sink are 75% higher than those of the reported N2O source from the coastal band. The balance between the oceanic region and the coastal band results in a sink region of 4.94 Gg of N2O during this period.

The SEP is characterized by strong coastal ocean upwelling, the coldest sea surface temperatures (SST) at comparable latitudes, the planet's most extensive subtropical stratocumulus deck, and a high and steep cordillera to the east. The VOCALS program is built on several research activities in SEP climate research (Mechoso and Wood 2010). The preceding Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System (EPIC) provided important insight on the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)/cold-tongue complex and marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds over the SEP.

T2  - Quaternary Science Reviews
AB  - We present a detailed record from Lago Lepué to examine vegetation, climate and fire-regime changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in central-east Isla Grande de Chiloé (43°S), northwestern Patagonia. Precipitation in this region correlates with the intensity of the southern westerly winds (SWW), allowing reconstruction of past SWW behavior through precipitation-sensitive sensors. Recession from the LGM glacier margins exposed the central-east sector of Isla Grande de Chiloé by 17,800calyrBP, followed by the immediate colonization of pioneer cold-resistant herbs/shrubs and rapid establishment of closed-canopy Nothofagus forests by 17,000calyrBP. Broad-leaved temperate rainforests have persisted since then with compositional changes driven by changes in temperature, hydrologic balance and disturbance regimes. We detect low lake levels and enhanced fire activity between 800-2000, 4000-4300, ∼8000-11,000 and 16,100-17,800calyrBP, implying southward shifts and/or weaker SWW flow that alternated with cold, humid phases with muted fire activity. Covariation in paleoclimate trends revealed by the Lago Lepué record with tropical and Antarctic records since the LGM, suggests that the SWW have been a highly dynamic component of the climate system capable of linking climate changes from low- and high-southern latitudes during the Last Glacial termination and the current interglacial. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effective radiative forcings (including rapid adjustments) and feedbacks associated with an instantaneous quadrupling of the preindustrial CO<inf>2</inf> concentration and a counterbalancing reduction of the solar constant are investigated in the context of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The forcing and feedback parameters of the net energy flux, as well as its different components at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface, were examined in 10 Earth System Models to better understand the impact of solar radiation management on the energy budget. In spite of their very different nature, the feedback parameter and its components at the TOA and surface are almost identical for the two forcing mechanisms, not only in the global mean but also in their geographical distributions. This conclusion holds for each of the individual models despite intermodel differences in how feedbacks affect the energy budget. This indicates that the climate sensitivity parameter is independent of the forcing (when measured as an effective radiative forcing). We also show the existence of a large contribution of the cloudy-sky component to the shortwave effective radiative forcing at the TOA suggesting rapid cloud adjustments to a change in solar irradiance. In addition, the models present significant diversity in the spatial distribution of the shortwave feedback parameter in cloudy regions, indicating persistent uncertainties in cloud feedback mechanisms. ©2014.

TI  - Summer Precipitation Events over the Western Slope of the Subtropical Andes
AU  - Viale, Maximiliano

T2  - Monthly Weather Review
AB  - Summertime [December-February (DJF)] precipitation over the western slopes of the subtropical Andes (32°-368°) accounts for less than 10% of the annual accumulation, but it mostly occurs as rain and may trigger landslides leading to serious damages. Based on 13 year of reanalysis, in situ observations, and satellite imagery, a synoptic climatology and physical diagnosis reveal two main weather types lead to distinct precipitation systems. The most frequent type (̃80% of the cases) occurs when a short-wave midlevel trough with weak winds and thermally driven mountain winds favor the development of convective precipitation during the daytime. The trough progresses northwest of a long-lasting warm ridge, which produces low-level easterly airflow that enhances its buoyancy as it moves over the arid land of western Argentina toward the Andes. The weak winds aloft facilitate the penetration of the moist easterly flow into the Andes. Midlevel flow coming from the west side of the Andes is decoupled from the low-level maritime air by a temperature inversion, and thus provides little moisture to support precipitation. The less frequent type (̃20% of the cases) occurs when a deep midlevel trough and strong westerly flow produces stratiform precipitation. This type has a baroclinic nature akin to winter storms, except that they are rare in summer and there is no evidence of a frontal passage at low levels. The lifting and cooling ahead of the trough erode the typical temperature inversion over the Pacific coast, and thus allows upslope transport of low-level marine air by the strong westerlies forming a precipitating cloud cap on the western slope of the Andes. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Formulation, calibration and validation of the DAIS model (version 1), a simple Antarctic ice sheet model sensitive to variations of sea level and ocean subsurface temperature
AU  - Shaffer, G.
T2  - Geoscientific Model Development
AB  - The DCESS (Danish Center for Earth System Science) Antarctic Ice Sheet (DAIS) model is presented. Model hindcasts of Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) sea level equivalent are forced by reconstructed Antarctic temperatures, global mean sea level and high-latitude, ocean subsurface temperatures, the latter calculated using the DCESS model forced by reconstructed global mean atmospheric temperatures. The model is calibrated by comparing such hindcasts for different model configurations with paleoreconstructions of AIS sea level equivalent from the last interglacial, the last glacial maximum and the mid-Holocene. The calibrated model is then validated against present estimates of the rate of AIS ice loss. It is found that a high-order dependency of ice flow at the grounding line on water depth there is needed to capture the observed response of the AIS at ice age terminations. Furthermore, it is found that a dependency of this ice flow on ocean subsurface temperature by way of ice shelf demise and a resulting buttressing decrease is needed to explain the contribution of the AIS to global mean sea level rise at the last interglacial. When forced and calibrated in this way, model hindcasts of the rate of present-day AIS ice loss agree with recent, data-based estimates of this ice loss rate. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - This study aimed at understanding the natural recovery of the evergreen forest a decade after being affected by clearcutting and burning, in a site located in the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (39°56’ S-73°40’ W). A total of 27 circular (50.2 m2) plots with eight subplots each were established. Floristic composition was recorded and quantitative, diametric and age structures were determined. The results show a richness of 77 vascular species (84.4% natives), with Lophosoria quadripinnata presenting the highest relative cover (20.7%). The presence of hemicryptophytes (35%) indicates human intervention in the place. Trees were the main form of growth, being Drimys winteri, Saxegothaea conspicua and Amomyrtus luma the species with higher plant density. The latter two species growing under Chusquea macrostachya and Lophosoria quadripinnata cover. Drimys winteri and Embothrium coccineum were established immediately after the anthropogenic disturbance of clearcutting and burning, confirming the pioneering character of these two species after highly severe disturbances. Regeneration of Nothofagus nitida was scarce in the area, probably associated with low availability and seed dispersal capacity from surrounding forests. Understanding the early response of evergreen forests affected by anthropogenic disturbance is very important for assisting and guiding the ecological restoration of these forest ecosystems.

AU  - Bozkurt, D

T2  - Climate Research
AB  - The hydrological discharge (HD) model of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is forced by a variety of climate model datasets to investigate the future of discharge in the Euphrates-Tigris Basin. The data include daily time series of surface runoff and sub-surface runoff outputs of 2 global climate models (GCMs) (the SRES A1B scenario simulation of ECHAM5/MPIOM and the RCP 4.5 scenario simulation of MPI-ESM-LR) and the dynamically downscaled outputs of ECHAM5/MPIOM and NCAR-CCSM3 scenario (SRES A1FI, A2 and B1) simulations. The suite of simulations enables a comprehensive analysis of the projected river discharge, and allows a comparison between CMIP5 simulations of MPI-ESM-LR and CMIP3 results from its predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM on a basin scale. We demonstrate that HD simulations forced with relatively low-resolution GCM outputs are not good at reproducing the seasonal cycle of discharge, which is typically characterized by less flow in the peak season and an earlier peak in annual discharge. Simulations forced with the MPI-ESM-LR yield more robust information on the annual cycle and timing of the annual peak discharge than ECHAM5-forced simulations. In contrast to GCM-forced simulations, high-resolution RCM-forced simulations reproduce the annual cycle of discharge reasonably well; however, overestimation of discharge during the cold season and bias in the timing of springtime snowmelt peaks persist in the RCM-forced simulations. Different RCM-forced scenario simulations indicate substantial decreases in mean annual discharge for the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers by the end of the century, ranging from 19-58%. Significant temporal shifts to earlier days (3-5 wk by the end of the 21st century) in the center time of the discharges are also projected for these rivers. As the basin is considered water-stressed and the region is strongly influenced by water-scarcity events, these unfavorable changes may potentially increase water disputes among the basin countries.

TI  - Characterization of the 1970s climate shift in South America
AU  - Jacques-Coper, Martín
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - The 1976-1977 cold-to-warm sea surface temperature (SST) shift in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which has been associated with a phase change of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, separated a 'La Niña-like' decadal regime from an 'El Niño-like' one. In this article, we analyse the differences of mean of annual and austral-summer (DJF) temperature, precipitation, and sea-level pressure (SLP) over South America (SA) between 1961-1973 and 1978-1990, and explore the occurrence of significant shifts in their time series. Our sources are instrumental records, gridded interpolated data, and reanalyses. Although major regional differences in the intensity of the signal are detected, the climate shift is identified in all variables. In the mid-1970s at annual level, reanalysis SLP data reveal the onset of a step-like anticyclonic circulation anomaly in the southern tip of SA and an abrupt weakening of the Southeast Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone (SEPA). This latter feature may have partly induced the rapid warming observed along the tropical-extratropical west coast of the continent through the weakening of the cold Humboldt current system. An abrupt warming was also detected in surface air temperature (SAT) composites located along the coast of the northern part of SA and in Southeastern SA (SESA). During summer, we found a particularly conspicuous shift-like warming over Southern South America (SSA, comprising Patagonia). Besides, a shift-like increase (decrease) in annual mean precipitation is observed over Central Argentina and in the tropics, to the south (north) of 10°S. In line with previous studies, we conclude that both the interannual (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and the interdecadal (PDO) variability modes seem to have had an incidence in the manifestation of the 1970s climate shift, and that its magnitude appears to be unprecedented during the 20th century, as shown in particular by century-long SAT composites from northern Chile and SSA.

T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - Modeling and mapping of cultural ecosystem services (CES) represents a significant gap in ecosystem service research. A GIS-based methodological framework was developed and applied to map agricultural heritage (AH), understood as a non-divisible combination of three cultural services (dimensions, D): the heritage value associated to a culturally significant species (i.e. Chiloé native potato) (D1); the traditional systems of knowledge of AH keepers (D2); and the social relations among them (D3). The final aim of the study was to provide indicators of the "final" service (AHi, measured in a 0-100 point scale) and its benefits (AHB, measured in US$/ha), capable to display areas where high value farmland was located. In essence, AHi comprised a set of biocultural variables validated and weighted by expert opinion. The experts gave the maximum importance to 5 variables: number of native potato varieties cultivated (D1), use of own seed (D1), form in which cultivation knowledge was acquired by the keeper (D2), exchange of own seed (D3), and number of other potato keepers known (D3). In turn, AHB reflected society's willingness to pay for the nonmaterial benefits of AH conservation. Since these benefits "propagate" across space extending from local to unknown and distant beneficiaries, and the aim was to identify the most valuable areas for their capacity to satisfy a potential demand, AHB was spatialized following the approach of "ascribing" the potential benefits to their "point of provision". Thus the highest values of AHi coincided with the highest values of AHB (US$10.64-8.64 ha-1) a comprised 5608 ha of the landscape, and similarly the lowest values of AHi matched the lowest values of AHB (US$1.69-0.18 ha-1) comprising 13,070 ha of the landscape. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The understanding of the long-term variation of large rivers streamflow with a high economic and social relevance is necessary in order to improve the planning and management of water resources in different regions of the world. The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20°S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100m3s-1 at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29,000km2 shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765-2004. Summer streamflow represents 45.2% of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (1961-2004) explains 54% of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R2adj=0.54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980s (τ=-0.633, p=1.0144*10-5 for the 1985-2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765. The Correlation of the Baker streamflow with the November-April observed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is significant (1961-2004, r=-0.55, p

AB  - Relationships between environmental factors and stem radius variation at short temporal scales can provide useful information regarding the sensitivity of tree species' productivity to climate change. This study used automatic point dendrometers to assess the relationship between environmental variables and stem radius contraction and increment in ten Fitzroya cupressoides trees growing in two sites, the Coastal Range (Alerce Costero National Park) and the Andean Cordillera (Alerce Andino National Park) of southern Chile. The growing season in each site, determined using stem daily cycle patterns for each month, was longer in the Coastal Range site than in the Andes. Warmer and sunnier conditions were positively related with daytime tree radius contraction in both areas, and relationships were stronger in the Coastal Range site where more pronounced shrinking events were associated with prolonged warm and dry conditions compared to the Andes. Stem increment was positively related with precipitation and humidity in both sites, reflecting the positive effect of water on cell turgidity and consequent enlargement. Relationships between stem radius change and environmental variables considering longer temporal scales (7 to 31 days), confirmed a stronger association with humidity/vapor pressure deficit and precipitation, rather than with temperature. Although Fitzroya grows in particularly wet and cool areas, current and projected drier and warmer summer conditions in southern Chile may have a negative effect on Fitzroya stem increment and carbon accumulation in both sites. This effect would be more critical in the Coastal Range compared with the Andes though, due in part to more limiting soil conditions and less summer precipitation in this area. Long-term research is needed to monitor different aspects of the response of these endangered ecosystems to this additional threat imposed by climate change.

T2  - Global Environmental Change
AB  - There is a growing use of resilience ideas within the disaster risk management literature and policy domain. However, few empirical studies have focused on how resilience ideas are conceptualized by practitioners, as they implement them in practice. Using Hajer's 'social-interactive discourse theory' this research contributes to the understanding of how practitioners frame, construct and make sense of resilience ideas in the context of changes in institutional arrangements for disaster risk management that explicitly include the resilience approach and climate change considerations. The case study involved the roll out of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia, and the study involved three sites in Queensland. The methods used were observation of different activities and the physical sites, revision of documents related to the Natural Disaster Resilience Program and in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants, all practitioners who had direct interaction with the program. The research findings show that practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience differently, and these are embedded in diverse storylines. Within these storylines, practitioners gave different interpretations and emphasis to the seven discourse categories that characterized their resilience discourse. Self-reliance emerged as one of the paramount discourse categories but we argue that caution needs to be used when promoting values of self-reliance. If the policy impetus is a focus on learning, research findings indicate it is also pertinent to move from experiential learning toward social learning. The results presented in this study provide helpful insights to inform policy design and implementation of resilience ideas in disaster risk management and climate change, and to inform theory.

AB  - While urbanites are vulnerable to a suite of risks that climate change might aggravate (e.g., mortality from extreme temperatures and property damages from floods), urban populations and decision makers may also be positioned to most effectively respond to such risks. Research is needed however, exploring both the multilevel factors and processes that determine urban risk and the complex pathways from hazards to impacts, and from perceptions and coping responses to adaptation. This paper analyzes whether and under what circumstances urban populations experience risk in selected Latin American neighborhoods of Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Mexico and Santiago; it assesses their adaptation capacity, i.e., ability to perceive and respond to hazards. It finds that urban risk depends on scale: hazards, adaptation capacities, responses and their underlying societal and physical drivers vary across urban households, neighborhoods and cities. Informality is a state of regulatory flux, where access to land and livelihood options cannot be fixed and mapped according to any prearranged sets of laws and planning mechanisms, that has a profound influence on risk and adaptation capacities across scales. For instance, informality becomes the site of considerable state power where some forms of growth in risk-prone areas enjoy state sanction while others are criminalized. The informal status becomes both a source of stigmatization that disempowers informal neighborhoods and a systemic determinant of lack of access to assets and options for adaptation capacity.

T2  - Computers & Fluids
AB  - The particular conditions of air circulation inside large open pit mines under intense insolation, dominated by mechanical and buoyant effects, are crucial when studying the dispersion of pollutants inside and outside the pit. Considering this, we study this problem using CFD tools able to include the complex geometry characterizing it and the different processes affecting circulation: flow interaction with obstacles, buoyancy, stratification and turbulence. We performed simulations using a previously developed OpenFOAM solver, focusing in the particular case of Chuquicamata, a large open pit mine (∼1. km deep) located in northern Chile. Both idealized and real topographies were used. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used LES to incorporate it in the calculation, using a DES approach to solve the flow near walls.The results from the idealized cases support the idea that buoyant currents foster the exit of particles from the pit and increase the turbulence inside its atmosphere, modifying the purely mechanical recirculatory flow inside the cavity. Differences in the air circulation and dispersion of particles between idealized and non-idealized cases are reported. In particular, there are changes in the intensity and location of the recirculation inside the pit due to variations in the aspect ratio (length/depth) of the cavity along the axis perpendicular to the main flow. Also, the topography surrounding the mine affects the main flow that sweeps the cavity, channeling it along the main axis of the pit and forcing it to enter the cavity through the lower level of the top edge. As a consequence, the patterns of pollutant transport observed in the idealized cases, dominated by near-wall upward currents, are different than those observed in the cases with complex topography, where the dispersion is dominated by internal buoyant upward currents. Anyhow, whether by internal or near wall upward currents, in all buoyant cases considered a large percentage of the particles injected inside the pit leaves the cavity.Further experiments studying the effect of 3D aspect ratio over the mechanically forced internal flow are needed to fully understand the effect of the internal geometry of the pit over the flow. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The winter time weather variability over the Mediterranean is studied in relation to the prevailing weather regimes (WRs) over the region. Using daily geopotential heights at 700 hPa from the ECMWF ERA40 Reanalysis Project and Cluster Analysis, four WRs are identified, in increasing order of frequency of occurrence, as cyclonic (22.0 %), zonal (24.8 %), meridional (25.2 %) and anticyclonic (28.0 %). The surface climate, cloud distribution and radiation patterns associated with these winter WRs are deduced from satellite (ISCCP) and other observational (E-OBS, ERA40) datasets. The LMDz atmosphere–ocean regional climate model is able to simulate successfully the same four Mediterranean weather regimes and reproduce the associated surface and atmospheric conditions for the present climate (1961–1990). Both observational- and LMDz-based computations show that the four Mediterranean weather regimes control the region’s weather and climate conditions during winter, exhibiting significant differences between them as for temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and radiation distributions within the region. Projections (2021–2050) of the winter Mediterranean weather and climate are obtained using the LMDz model and analysed in relation to the simulated changes in the four WRs. According to the SRES A1B emission scenario, a significant warming (between 2 and 4 °C) is projected to occur in the region, along with a precipitation decrease by 10–20 % in southern Europe, Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, against a 10 % precipitation increase in northern European areas. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation in the Mediterranean are explained by the model-predicted changes in the frequency of occurrence as well as in the intra-seasonal variability of the regional weather regimes. The anticyclonic configuration is projected to become more recurrent, contributing to the decreased precipitation over most of the basin, while the cyclonic and zonal ones become more sporadic, resulting in more days with below normal precipitation over most of the basin, and on the eastern part of the region, respectively. The changes in frequency and intra-seasonal variability highlights the usefulness of dynamics versus statistical downscaling techniques for climate change studies.

AB  - The significance and cause of the decline in biomass burning across the Americas after ad 1500 is a topic of considerable debate. We synthesized charcoal records (a proxy for biomass burning) from the Americas and from the remainder of the globe over the past 2000 years, and compared these with paleoclimatic records and population reconstructions. A distinct post-ad 1500 decrease in biomass burning is evident, not only in the Americas, but also globally, and both are similar in duration and timing to ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change. There is temporal and spatial variability in the expression of the biomass-burning decline across the Americas but, at a regional–continental scale, ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change was likely more important than indigenous population collapse in driving this decline.

AB  - The 2008-2009 eruption of Chaitén Volcano (Chile) involved a variety of volcanic and associated hydrologic processes that damaged nearby forests. These processes included coarse (gravel) and fine (silt to sand) tephra fall, a laterally directed blast, fluvial deposition of remobilized tephra, a variety of low-temperature mass-movement processes, and a pyroclastic flow. Each of these geophysical processes constitutes a type of ecosystem disturbance which involves a distinctive suite of disturbance mechanisms, namely burial by tephra and sediment, heating, abrasion, impact force, and canopy loading (accumulation of tephra in tree crowns). Each process affected specific areas, and created patches and disturbance gradients in the forest landscape. Coarse tephra (‘gravel rain’, >5 cm depth) abraded foliage from tree canopies over an area of approximately 50 km2 north-northeast of the vent. Fine tephra (>10 cm depth) accumulated in tree crowns and led to breakage of branches in old forest and bowing of flexible, young trees over an area of about 480 km2. A directed blast down the north flank of the volcano damaged forest over an area of 4 km2. This blast zone included an area of tree removal near the crater rim, toppled forest farther down the slope, and standing, scorched forest around the blast perimeter. Fluvial deposition of >100 cm of remobilized tephra, beginning about 10 days after initiation of the eruption, buried floodplain forest in distinct, elongate streamside patches covering 5 km2 of the lower 19 km of the Rayas River and several km2 of the lower Chaitén River. Across this array of disturbance processes the fate of affected trees varied from complete mortality in the tree removal and pyroclastic flow areas, to no mortality in areas of thin tephra fall deposits. Tree damage included defoliation, loss of branches, snapping of tree trunks, abrasion of bark and ephiphytes, and uprooting. Damaged trees sprouted from epicormic buds located in trunks and branches, but sprouting varied over time among disturbance mechanisms and species. Although some effects of the Chaitén eruption are very similar to those from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (USA), interactions between biota and geophysical processes at Chaitén produced some unique effects. Examination of vegetation response helps interpret geophysical processes, and disturbance mechanisms influence early stages of biotic response to an eruption.

AB  - Patagonia, located in southern South America, is a vast and remote region holding a rich variety of past environmental records but a small number of meteorological stations. Precipitation over this region is mostly produced by disturbances embedded in the westerly flow and is strongly modified by the austral Andes. Uplift on the windward side leads to hyperhumid conditions along the Pacific coast and the western slope of the Andes; in contrast, downslope subsidence dries the eastern plains leading to arid, highly evaporative conditions.The authors investigate the dependence of Patagonia’s local climate (precipitation and near-surface air temperature) year-to-year variability on large-scale circulation anomalies using results from a 30-yr-long high-resolution numerical simulation. Variations of the low-level zonal wind account for a large fraction of the rainfall variability at synoptic and interannual time scales. Zonal wind also controls the amplitude of the air temperature annual cycle by changing the intensity of the seasonally varying temperature advection.The main modes of year-to-year variability of the zonal flow over southern South America are also investigated. Year round there is a dipole between mid- and high latitudes. The node separating wind anomalies of opposite sign migrates through the seasons, leading to a dipole over Patagonia during austral summer and a monopole during winter. Reanalysis data also suggests that westerly flow has mostly decreased over north-central Patagonia during the last four decades, causing a drying trend to the west of the Andes, but a modest increase is exhibited over the southern tip of the continent.

AB  - Megacities are not only important drivers for socio-economic development but also sources of environmental challenges. Many megacities and large urban agglomerations are located in the coastal zone where land, atmosphere, and ocean meet, posing multiple environmental challenges which we consider here. The atmospheric flow around megacities is complicated by urban heat island effects and topographic flows and sea breezes and influences air pollution and human health. The outflow of polluted air over the ocean perturbs biogeochemical processes. Contaminant inputs can damage downstream coastal zone ecosystem function and resources including fisheries, induce harmful algal blooms and feedback to the atmosphere via marine emissions. The scale of influence of megacities in the coastal zone is hundreds to thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere and tens to hundreds of kilometers in the ocean. We list research needs to further our understanding of coastal megacities with the ultimate aim to improve their environmental management.

T2  - Computers & Fluids
AB  - This paper, first of a two-part work, presents an overview of the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver in OpenFOAM platform to simulate the internal ventilation regime within an open pit including the effects of developed turbulence, buoyancy and stratification. To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined.

The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.

AU  - Rojas, M.
T2  - Geophysical Research Letters
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) versus high CO2 world boundary condition on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, in particular on the strength and latitudinal position of the near surface Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). PMIP2 and PMIP3 experiments, as well as the “abrupt 4 × CO2” simulations from CMIP5, were analyzed. Robust findings include poleward expansion of the Mean Meridional Circulation (MMC) and intensified and poleward-shifted SWW in the 4 × CO2 simulations (consistent with recent observations and 21st century climate change projections); and for the LGM, stronger and southward shifted northern hemisphere MMC, and weakened southern Hadley cell. However, six of the eight LGM simulations show a decrease in the SWW, the other two models simulate the opposite. A critical difference between the models is strong coupling between sea-ice extent, surface temperature gradients, SWW, and Ferrel cell in the two models with stronger and poleward-shifted SWW.

AB  - The responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other climate variables to an emission pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere are often used to compute the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), to characterize the response timescales of Earth System models, and to build reduced-form models. In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 ± 9% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 ± 12% and the land the remainder (16 ± 14%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 ± 0.12 °C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.

AB  - Paleontological and archaeological sites have frequently been found in open locations of the Intermediate Depression of south-central Chile. This paper presents the results of two field sampling seasons carried out at the Pilauco Site (ca. 39°S) and compares them with those of three well known sites in Chile: Quereo, Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, ca. 32°, 34° and 41°S, respectively. Stratigraphic data collected at Pilauco and the resulting radiocarbon age model suggest that before 12,540 ± 90 BP the old Damas River eroded an older volcaniclastic hill, which was followed by a bog formation in an ox-bow lake. The site was developing up to 11,004 ± 186 BP, the date of the youngest vertebrate fossil. Two younger peat beds seal the site. As in Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, Gomphotheres are the most represented megafauna. Fossils of Equidae, Camelidae, Cervidae, Mephitidae, Muridae, Myocastoridae and Xenarthra are also found in Pilauco. As a whole, 718 bones, 30 teeth and 11 coprolites represent the extinct and extant vertebrates. Preliminary taphonomic results suggest action of various agents in the bones, i.e. trampling, root etching, abrasion, and carnivore gnawing. The spatial analysis suggests the transfer of smaller anatomical units (e.g. bones of camelids and horses) and the rearrangement of some pieces comparatively large (e.g. gomphothere bones). Similar to the present day north Patagonian landscape, the area where Pilauco site is located had a variety of animal resources, plants and stones in an ecotone between hills, floodplains and wetlands. A total of 101 lithics were recorded: basalt and quartzite were collected from nearby fluvial deposits and dacitic obsidian from the local volcaniclastic deposits. Debitage is the most represented lithic item (75%); cores and marginal edge-trimmed artifacts represented 12 and 13%, respectively. Artifacts and flakes are spatially and temporality associated in the same PB-7 bed with high bone concentrations in some specific areas, between 361 and 424 cm of local altitude. This industry is characterized by a recurrent lithic expedite technology with production of flakes and chips which mastered marginal retouches over the bifacial trimming. This seems to be connected to strategic conditions of high resource diversity, especially of human groups with a high or medium mobility across land. Pilauco represents a site contemporaneous to Monte Verde related as well to the first human occupation in the southern cone of South America, but with higher mammal diversity.

AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are interlinked by primary production, respiration and decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems1. It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological activity is mainly driven by water availability6, 7, 8. The increase in aridity predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide9, 10, 11 may therefore threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the availability of essential nutrients12, 13, 14. Here we evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition12, 13, 14. Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key services provided by these ecosystems.

AB  - This paper summarizes the results of an intercomparison project with Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) undertaken in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The focus is on long-term climate projections designed to 1) quantify the climate change commitment of different radiative forcing trajectories and 2) explore the extent to which climate change is reversible on human time scales. All commitment simulations follow the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and their extensions to year 2300. Most EMICs simulate substantial surface air temperature and thermosteric sea level rise commitment following stabilization of the atmospheric composition at year-2300 levels. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is weakened temporarily and recovers to near-preindustrial values in most models for RCPs 2.6–6.0. The MOC weakening is more persistent for RCP8.5. Elimination of anthropogenic CO2 emissions after 2300 results in slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At year 3000 atmospheric CO2 is still at more than half its year-2300 level in all EMICs for RCPs 4.5–8.5. Surface air temperature remains constant or decreases slightly and thermosteric sea level rise continues for centuries after elimination of CO2 emissions in all EMICs. Restoration of atmospheric CO2 from RCP to preindustrial levels over 100–1000 years requires large artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and does not result in the simultaneous return to preindustrial climate conditions, as surface air temperature and sea level response exhibit a substantial time lag relative to atmospheric CO2.

T2  - Climate of the Past
AB  - Both historical and idealized climate model experiments are performed with a variety of Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) as part of a community contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. Historical simulations start at 850 CE and continue through to 2005. The standard simulations include changes in forcing from solar luminosity, Earth's orbital configuration, CO2, additional greenhouse gases, land use, and sulphate and volcanic aerosols. In spite of very different modelled pre-industrial global surface air temperatures, overall 20th century trends in surface air temperature and carbon uptake are reasonably well simulated when compared to observed trends. Land carbon fluxes show much more variation between models than ocean carbon fluxes, and recent land fluxes appear to be slightly underestimated. It is possible that recent modelled climate trends or climate–carbon feedbacks are overestimated resulting in too much land carbon loss or that carbon uptake due to CO2 and/or nitrogen fertilization is underestimated. Several one thousand year long, idealized, 2 × and 4 × CO2 experiments are used to quantify standard model characteristics, including transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities, and climate–carbon feedbacks. The values from EMICs generally fall within the range given by general circulation models. Seven additional historical simulations, each including a single specified forcing, are used to assess the contributions of different climate forcings to the overall climate and carbon cycle response. The response of surface air temperature is the linear sum of the individual forcings, while the carbon cycle response shows a non-linear interaction between land-use change and CO2 forcings for some models. Finally, the preindustrial portions of the last millennium simulations are used to assess historical model carbon-climate feedbacks. Given the specified forcing, there is a tendency for the EMICs to underestimate the drop in surface air temperature and CO2 between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age estimated from palaeoclimate reconstructions. This in turn could be a result of unforced variability within the climate system, uncertainty in the reconstructions of temperature and CO2, errors in the reconstructions of forcing used to drive the models, or the incomplete representation of certain processes within the models. Given the forcing datasets used in this study, the models calculate significant land-use emissions over the pre-industrial period. This implies that land-use emissions might need to be taken into account, when making estimates of climate–carbon feedbacks from palaeoclimate reconstructions.

AB  - Questions

Is the macrolichen Usnea antarctica a ‘nurse’ species to Antarctic flora? Are positive plant–plant interactions more frequent than negative interactions in Antarctic ecosystems? Are microclimatic modifications by cushions of U. antarctica responsible for the nurse effect?


Location

Two sites in Antarctica: King George Island, South Shetland (62°11′ S, 58°56′ W; 62°11′ S, 58°59′ W).


Methods

We evaluated the association of plant species with U. antarctica cushions by recording species growing – in equivalent areas – within and outside U. antarctica cushions. Additionally, we performed transplant experiments with Deschampsia antarctica individuals to assess if U. antarctica cushions enhance plant survival. In both study sites we monitored temperature, moisture and nutrient status of soil outside and within the cushions to provide insights into potential mechanisms underlying possible interactions between U. antarctica and other plant species.


Results

Eight out of 13 species were positively associated with cushions of the widespread lichen U. antarctica, while only one species (U. aurantiaco-atra) showed a negative association with U. antarctica. Survival of Deschampsia was enhanced when growing associated with U. antarctica cushions. Our results indicate that cushions ameliorated the extreme conditions of Antarctic islands through increased temperature and soil moisture, decreased radiation and evaporative water loss and increased nutrient availability.


Conclusions

The nurse effect of U. antarctica is verified. Cushions of this macrolichen may be a key component in structuring the Antarctic landscape and maintaining local species richness, and their presence might influence range expansion of other species.

TI  - Warm Winter Storms in Central Chile
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
AB  - Central Chile is a densely populated region along the west coast of subtropical SouthAmerica (30°-36°S), limited to the east by the Andes. Precipitation is concentrated in austral winter, mostly associated with the passage of cold fronts. The freezing level over central Chile is typically between 1500 and 2500m when precipitation is present. In about a third of the cases, however, precipitation occurs accompanied by warm temperatures and freezing levels above 3000 m, leading to a sizeable increment in the pluvial area of Andean basins and setting the stage for hydrometeorological hazards. Here, warm winter storms in central Chile are studied, including a statistical description of their occurrence and an estimate of their hydrological impacts. Remote-sensed data and high-resolution reanalysis are used to explore the synoptic-scale environment of a typical case, generalized later by a compositing analysis. The structure of warm storms is also contrasted with that of the more recurrent cold cases. Precipitation during warm events occurs in the warm sector of a slow-moving cold front because of the intense moisture flux against the mountains in connection with a land-falling atmospheric river. This is in turn driven by a strong zonal jet aloft and reduced mechanical blocking upstream of the Andes. On a broader scale, a key element is the presence of a slowly moving anticyclone over the south Pacific, fostering advection of cold air intomidlatitudes. The intense and persistent zonal jet stretches a moist-air corridor from the central Pacific to the west coast of South America. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Araucaria araucana (Araucaria) is a long-lived conifer growing along a sharp west–east biophysical gradient in the Patagonian Andes. The patterns and climate drivers of Araucaria growth have typically been documented on the driest part of the gradient relying on correlations with meteorological records, but the lack of in situ soil moisture observations has precluded an assessment of the growth responses to soil moisture variability. Here, we use a network of 21 tree-ring width chronologies to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of tree growth through the entire gradient and evaluate their linkages with regional climate and satellite-observed surface soil moisture variability. We found that temporal variations in tree growth are remarkably similar throughout the gradient and largely driven by soil moisture variability. The regional spatiotemporal pattern of tree growth was positively correlated with precipitation (r = 0.35 for January 1920–1974; P < 0.01) and predominantly negatively correlated with temperature (r = −0.38 for January–March 1920–1974; P < 0.01) during the previous growing season. These correlations suggest a temporally lagged growth response to summer moisture that could be associated with known physiological carry-over processes in conifers and to a response to moisture variability at deeper layers of the rooting zone. Notably, satellite observations revealed a previously unobserved response of Araucaria growth to summer surface soil moisture during the current rather than the previous growing season (r = 0.65 for 1979–2000; P < 0.05). This new response has a large spatial footprint across the mid-latitudes of the South American continent (35°–45°S) and highlights the potential of Araucaria tree rings for palaeoclimatic applications. The strong moisture constraint on tree growth revealed by satellite observations suggests that projected summer drying during the coming decades may result in regional growth declines in Araucaria forests and other water-limited ecosystems in the Patagonian Andes.

AB  - [1] Observations were performed in 12 communities of Central Chile in order to determine the horizontal gradients of ozone in the Santiago Basin and surrounding valleys. Higher ozone mixing ratios were found northeast of the Santiago Basin and included east of the Aconcagua Valley (~70 km from Santiago) suggesting that photochemical pollution produced in Santiago is capable of passing through the Chacabuco mountain chain (~1.3 km) and have impact downwind from the regions with the largest NOx and VOC emissions. To complement existing surface observations, ozonesonde and tethersonde campaigns were performed in the Santiago Basin and the Aconcagua Valley. The results suggest ozone can accumulate in layers aloft (e.g., >102 ppb at 2 km) similarly to layers observed in complex topography coastal regions like Southern California. Layers of significant ozone concentrations having a near surface origin were observed above the mixed layer and below the subsidence inversion base. We propose that the ozone in this residual layer can be transported large distances (at least to 70 km) to further penetrate into the local environment under conditions of a well-mixed boundary layer.

AB  - The Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is a key player in global-scale oceanic overturning processes and an important conduit for heat, fresh water, and carbon transport. The AAIW past variability is poorly understood mainly due to the lack of sedimentary archives at intermediate water depths. We present records of benthic stable isotopes from sediments retrieved with the seafloor drill rig MARUM-MeBo at 956 m water depth off northern Chile (GeoB15016, 27°29.48′S, 71°07.58′W) that extend back to 970 ka. The sediments at this site are presently deposited at the boundary between AAIW and Pacific Deep Water (PDW). For previous peak interglacials, our results reveal similar benthic δ13C values at site GeoB15016 and of a newly generated stack of benthic δ13C from various deep Pacific cores representing the "average PDW." This suggests, unlike today, the absence of AAIW at the site and the presence of nearly pure PDW. In contrast, more positive δ13C values at site GeoB15016 compared to the stack imply a considerable AAIW contribution during cold phases of interglacials and especially during glacials. Besides, we used three short sediment cores to reconstruct benthic δ13C values from the AAIW core during the last glacial and found a δ13C signature similar to today's. Assuming that this was the case also for the past 970 kyr, we demonstrate that sea level changes and latitudinal migrations of the AAIW formation site can only account for about 50% of the full range of past δ13C increases at site GeoB15016 during cold periods. Other processes that could explain the remaining of the positive δ13C anomalies are increases in glacial AAIW production and/or deeper convection of the AAIW with respect to preceding interglacials. Key Points Absence of AAIW off northern Chile during past peak interglacial periods Increase advection of AAIW to the northern Chilean margin during cold periods Present and LGM AAIW production similar and the highest since 970 ka ©2013.

T2  - Aerosol and Air Quality Research
AB  - We explore the relationship between satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface aerosol mass concentrations over a subtropical urban area, namely, Santiago, Chile (33.5°S, 70.6°W, 500 m.a.s.l.). We compare 11 years of AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with in situ particulate matter mass concentrations (PM). MODIS AOD reaches its maximum in summer and minimum in winter, the opposite of the annual cycle of surface PM. To improve our understanding of the relevant governing processes, we use a simple model that estimates the boundary layer (BL) AOD based on measured PM, relative humidity and BL height (BLH) as well as best estimates of aerosol composition, size distribution, and optical properties. Model results indicate that a weak annual AOD cycle is due to the opposite annual cycles in BLH and PM, which is largely supported by the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data collected in 2001 and 2002 in Santiago. We identify a possible bias linked to the operational estimate of surface reflectance that may lead to a spurious summer maximum in MODIS AOD over Santiago. This misfit in surface reflectance appears to affect not only Santiago but also a significant area of the semi-arid Southern South America. Sensitivity experiments with the simple model indicate an underestimate of simulated AOD as compared to AERONET data. This underestimate points to the possible role of residual aerosol layers in the AOD measured at the surface (not included in the simple model). Cirrus clouds appear not to play a significant role in explaining the MODIS AOD seasonality. The need for improved characterizations of aerosol properties and their temporal and spatial distribution in cities such as Santiago is emphasized.

TI  - A synoptic climatology of the near-surface wind along the west coast of South America
AU  - Rahn, David A.
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - Prevailing wind along the west coast of South America is equatorward, driven by the southeast Pacific anticyclone. The wind induces strong coastal upwelling that supports one of the most important fisheries in the world. This region lacks a dense network of in situ observations, so the high resolution (0.313°) NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis is used here to present a synoptic climatology of the coastal wind along the Chile/Peru coast. Covariability between the alongshore pressure gradient and alongshore wind, which was previously identified for synoptic time scales near central Chile, is generalized for the whole coast and over annual time scales. Particular attention is paid to three prominent upwelling regions: Pisco (14.8°S), Punta Lengua de Vaca (30.0°S), and Punta Lavapie (36.4°S). Previous work has identified local maxima at these points but these are embedded in a broader low-level jet that exhibits a marked seasonal cycle of strong wind days due to the migration of the anticyclone and is associated with a shift of both the mean wind and a more frequent recurrence of strong wind events. Alongshore wind near Pisco is normally distributed year-round with a seasonal shift in the mean. Larger variability in the mean and distribution is found at Lavapie, associated with the seasonal change in storm tracks. The synoptic evolution that drives high-wind events at each location is characterized. A midlevel trough and surface cyclone precede wind maxima at each location and are followed by strong midlevel ridging and a strengthened surface anticyclone.

AB  - Past global climate changes had strong regional expression. To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi- decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971–2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years. D

AB  - In this work, we present combined statistical indexes for evaluating air quality monitoring networks based on concepts derived from the information theory and Kullback–Liebler divergence. More precisely, we introduce: (1) the standard measure of complementary mutual information or ‘specificity’ index; (2) a new measure of information gain or ‘representativity’ index; (3) the information gaps associated with the evolution of a network and (4) the normalised information distance used in clustering analysis. All these information concepts are illustrated by applying them to 14 yr of data collected by the air quality monitoring network in Santiago de Chile (33.5 S, 70.5 W, 500 m a.s.l.). We find that downtown stations, located in a relatively flat area of the Santiago basin, generally show high ‘representativity’ and low ‘specificity’, whereas the contrary is found for a station located in a canyon to the east of the basin, consistently with known emission and circulation patterns of Santiago. We also show interesting applications of information gain to the analysis of the evolution of a network, where the choice of background information is also discussed, and of mutual information distance to the classifications of stations. Our analyses show that information as those presented here should of course be used in a complementary way when addressing the analysis of an air quality network for planning and evaluation purposes.

T2  - Progress in Oceanography
AB  - Coastal upwelling ecosystems are areas of high productivity and strong outgassing, where most gases, such as N2O and CH4, are produced in subsurface waters by anaerobic metabolisms. We describe seasonal CH4 variation as well as potential mechanisms producing CH4 in surface waters of the central Chile upwelling ecosystem (36°S). Surface waters were always supersaturated in CH4 (from 125% up to 550%), showing a clear seasonal signal triggered by wind driven upwelling processes (austral spring-summer period), that matched with the periods of high chlorophyll-a and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) levels. Methane cycling experiments, with/without the addition of dimethylsulfide (including 13C-DMS) and acetylene (a nonspecific inhibitor of CH4 oxidation) along with monthly measurements of CH4, DMSP and other oceanographic variables revealed that DMS can be a CH4 precursor. Net CH4 cycling rates (control) fluctuated between -0.64 and 1.44nmolL-1d-1. After the addition of acetylene, CH4 cycling rates almost duplicated relative to the control, suggesting a strong methanotrophic activity. With a spike of DMS, the net CH4 cycling rate significantly increased relative to the acetylene and control treatment. Additionally, the δ13C values of CH4 at the end of the incubations (after addition of 13C enriched-DMS) were changed, reaching -32‰ PDB compared to natural values between -44‰ and -46‰ PDB. These findings indicate that, in spite of the strong CH4 consumption by methanotrophs, this upwelling area is an important source of CH4 to the atmosphere. The effluxes are derived partially from in situ surface production and seem to be related to DMSP/DMS metabolism. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans
AB  - The effect of the high frequency (synoptic) variability of wind and heat fluxes upon the surface ocean off south-central Chile (west coast of South America) is investigated using a regional ocean model. We focus our analysis in austral summer, when the regional wind experiences significant day-to-day variability superimposed on a mean, upwelling favorable flow. To evaluate the nature and magnitude of these effects, we performed three identical simulations except for the surface forcing: the climatological run, with long-term monthly mean wind-stresses and heat fluxes; the wind-synoptic run, with daily wind stresses and climatological heat fluxes; and the full-synoptic run, with daily wind-stresses and daily fluxes. The mean currents and surface geostrophic EKE fields show no major differences between simulations, and agree well with those observed in this ocean area. Nevertheless, substantially more ageostrophic EKE is found in the simulations which include synoptic variability of wind-stresses, impacting the total surface EKE and diffusivities, particularly south of Punta Lavapie (37° S), where the lack of major currents implies low levels of geostrophic EKE. Summer mean SSTs are similar in all simulations and agree with observations, but SST variability along the coast is larger in the runs including wind-stress synoptic variability, suggesting a rather linear response of the ocean to cycles of southerly wind strengthening and relaxation. We found that coastal SST variability does not change significantly in the first tenths of kilometers from the shore when including daily heat fluxes, highlighting the prominent role of wind-driven upwelling cycles. In contrast, in the offshore region situated beyond the 50 km coastal strip, it is necessary to include synoptic variability in the heat fluxes to account for a realistic SST variability.

T2  - Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
AB  - Surface coastal observations from two automatic weather stations at Paposo (~25° S) and radiosonde observations at Paposo and Iquique (~20° S) were carried out during VOCALS-REx (VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment). Within the coastal marine boundary layer (MBL), sea–land breezes are superimposed on the prevailing southerlies, resulting in light northeasterly winds from midnight to early morning and strong southwesterlies in the afternoon. The prevailing northerlies above the MBL and below the top of the Andes are modulated by the onshore-offshore (zonal) flow forced by the diurnal cycle of surface heating/cooling along the western slope of the Andes. The daytime phase of this diurnal cycle is consistent with an enhanced afternoon coastal subsidence manifested in afternoon warming near the top of the subsidence inversion (~1.8 K at 800 hPa), lowering (~130 m) of its base (top of the MBL), and clearing of coastal Sc (stratocumulus) clouds. Results from a numerical simulation of the atmospheric circulation in a mean zonal cross section over the study area capture the afternoon zonal wind divergence and resulting subsidence of about 2 cm s−1 along a narrow (~10 km) coastal strip maximizing at around 800 hPa. Day-to-day variability in the MBL depth during VOCALS-REx shows sub-synoptic oscillations, aside from two major disruptions in connection with a deep trough and a cutoff low, as described elsewhere. These oscillations are phase-locked to those in sea-level pressure and afternoon alongshore southerlies, as found in connection with coastal lows farther south. 

From 24-h forward trajectories issued from significant points at the coast and inland at the extremes of the diurnal cycle, it can be concluded that the strong mean daytime Andean pumping prevents any possibility of continental sulfur sources from reaching the free troposphere above the Sc cloud deck in at least a one-day timescale, under mean conditions. Conversely, coastal sources could contribute with sulfur aerosols preferentially in the morning, provided that the weak daytime inland flow becomes partially blocked by the coastal terrain.

AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0–100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area.

AB  - Despite the importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the global radiative balance and atmospheric ozone chemistry, its sources and sinks within the Earth's system are still poorly understood. In the ocean, N2O is produced by microbiological processes such as nitrification and partial denitrification, which account for about a third of global emissions. Conversely, complete denitrification (the dissimilative reduction of N2O to N2) under suboxic/anoxic conditions is the only known pathway accountable for N2O consumption in the ocean. In this work, it is demonstrated that the biological assimilation of N2O could be a significant pathway capable of directly transforming this gas into particulate organic nitrogen (PON). N2O is shown to be biologically fixed within the subtropical and tropical waters of the eastern South Pacific Ocean, under a wide range of oceanographic conditions and at rates ranging from 2 pmol N L(-1) d(-) to 14.8 nmol N L(-1) d(-1) (mean ± SE of 0.522 ± 1.06 nmol N L(-1) d(-1), n = 93). Additional assays revealed that cultured cyanobacterial strains of Trichodesmium (H-9 and IMS 101), and Crocosphaera (W-8501) have the capacity to directly fix N2O under laboratory conditions; suggesting that marine photoautotrophic diazotrophs could be using N2O as a substrate. This metabolic capacity however was absent in Synechococcus (RCC 1029). The findings presented here indicate that assimilative N2O fixation takes place under extreme environmental conditions (i.e., light, nutrient, oxygen) where both autotrophic (including cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic microbes appear to be involved. This process could provide a globally significant sink for atmospheric N2O which in turn affects the oceanic N2O inventory and may also represent a yet unexplored global oceanic source of fixed N.

AB  - Over much of the ocean’s surface, productivity and growth are limited by a scarcity of bioavailable nitrogen. Sedimentary δ15N records spanning the last deglaciation suggest marked shifts in the nitrogen cycle during this time, but the quantification of these changes has been hinderedby the complexity of nitrogen isotope cycling. Herewe present a database of δ15Nin sediments throughout the world’s oceans, including 2,329 modern seafloor samples, and 76 timeseries spanning the past 30,000 years. We showthat the δ15Nvalues of modern seafloor sediments are consistent with values predicted by our knowledge of nitrogen cycling in thewater column. Despite many local deglacial changes, the globally averaged δ15N values of sinking organic matter were similar during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene. Considering the global isotopic mass balance, we explain these observations with the following deglacial history of nitrogen inventory processes. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the nitrogen cycle was near steady state. During the deglaciation, denitrification in the pelagic water column accelerated. The flooding of continental shelves subsequently increased denitrification at the seafloor, and denitrification reached near steady-state conditions again in the Early Holocene.We use a recent parameterization of seafloor denitrification to estimate a 30–120% increase in benthic denitrification between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago. Based on the similarity of globally averaged δ15N values during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene, we infer that pelagic denitrification must have increased by a similar amount between the two steady states.

AB  - The potential of landscapes to supply multiple benefits to society beyond commodities production has received increasing research and policy attention. Linking the concept of multifunctionality with the ecosystem services (ES) approach offers a promising avenue for producing scientific evidence to inform landscape planning, e.g., about the relative utility of land-sharing and land-sparing. However, the value for decision-making of ES-based multifunctionality assessments has been constrained by a significant conceptual and methodological dispersion. To contribute towards a cohesive framework for landscape multifunctionality, we analyse case studies of joint ES supply regarding ten criteria designed to ultimately answer four aspects: (i) the multifunctionality of what (e.g., landscapes), (ii) the type of multifunctionality (e.g., based on ES synergies), (iii) the procedure of multifunctionality assessments, and (iv) the purpose of multifunctionality. We constructed a typology of methodological approaches based on scores for criteria describing the evaluation method and the level of stakeholder participation in assessments of joint ES supply. Surveyed studies and underlying types of methodological approaches (spatial, socio-spatial, functional, spatio-functional) differed in most criteria. We illustrate the influence of methodological divergence on planning recommendations by comparing two studies employing contrasting approaches (spatial and functional) to assess the joint supply of wildlife habitat and agricultural production in the Argentine Chaco. We distinguish between a pattern-based and process-based multifunctionality, where the latter can only be detected through approaches considering the ecological processes (e.g., ES complementarities) supporting the supply of multiple ES (functional and spatio-functional). Finally, we propose an integrated approach for assessing a socially-relevant process-based multifunctionality.

T2  - Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science
AB  - The Tubul-Raqui estuary is a coastal system off central Chile at 37°S, adjacent to an active coastal upwelling area, which undergoes rapid changes associated with natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578%) and CH4 (up to 6200%) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from-319 to 714mmolm-2d-1) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5mmolm-2d-1) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 μmol m-2 d-1. These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predicting how the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will change with global warming is of enormous importance to society 1-4. ENSO exhibits considerable natural variability at interdecadal–centennial timescales5. Instrumental records are too short to determine whether ENSO has changed6 and existing reconstructions are often developed without adequate tropical records. Here we present a seven-century-long ENSO reconstruction based on 2,222 tree-ring chronologies from both the tropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. The inclusion of tropical records enables us to achieve unprecedented accuracy, as attested by high correlations with equatorial Pacific corals 7-8 and coherent modulation of global teleconnections that are consistent with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction9. Our data indicate that ENSO activity in the late twentieth century was anomalously high over the past seven centuries, suggestive of a response to continuing global warming. Climate models disagree on the ENSO response to global warming 3-4, suggesting that many models underestimate the sensitivity to radiative perturbations. Illustrating the radiative effect, our reconstruction reveals a robust ENSO response to large tropical eruptions, with anomalous cooling in the east-central tropical Pacific in the year of eruption, followed by anomalous warming one year after. Our observations provide crucial constraints for improving climate models and their future projections.

AB  - Scholars have focused on understanding the motivations behind urban authorities' efforts to respond to climate change, yet the determinants of institutional response capacity are less well known, particularly in Latin America. This paper develops a framework to understand the political–economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and top-down decision making. However, both also have similar opportunities, such as leadership, participation in transnational networks, and potential to integrate climate change goals into existing policy agendas. Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity.

AB  - Purpose: To confront the increasingly devastating impacts of disasters and the challenges that climate change is posing to disaster risk management (DRM) there is an imperative to further develop DRM. The resilience approach is emerging as one way to do this, and in the last decade has been strongly introduced into the policy arena, although it is not new for DRM practitioners and researchers. Nevertheless, resilience is a highly contested issue, and there is no agreed definition of it, which has resulted in confusion for stakeholders when applying it to practice. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how resilience is framed by researchers and DRM practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical framework used was Hajer's "social-interactive discourse theory", combined with analysis of government documents, in-depth interviews with practitioners and observation of field and practices within the context of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia. Findings: One of the key findings is that the idea of "bouncing back" is central to the resilience discourse but different interpretations of this idea results in real-world implications. Three different ways (storylines) in which practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience emerge from this study. Importantly the divergences between these storylines reveal possibilities for reframing to occur and these could lead to different policy options and practices. Originality/value: The results presented in this paper offer empirical evidence on how resilience is understood on the ground, contributing to extending resilience theory and informing DRM and resilience practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Growing concern about the loss of ecosystem services (ES) promotes their spatial representation as a key tool for the internalization of the ES framework into land use policies. Paradoxically, mapping approaches meant to inform policy decisions focus on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the biophysical supply of ES, largely ignoring the social mechanisms by which these services influence human wellbeing. If social mechanisms affecting ES demand, enhancing it or reducing it, are taken more into account, then policies are more effective. By developing and applying a new mapping routine to two distinct socio-ecological systems, we show a strong spatial uncoupling between ES supply and socio-ecological vulnerability to the loss of ES, under scenarios of land use and cover change. Public policies based on ES supply might not only fail at detecting priority conservation areas for the wellbeing of human societies, but may also increase their vulnerability by neglecting areas of currently low, but highly valued ES supply.

AB  - Spatial environmental heterogeneity influences diversity of organisms at different scales. Environmental filtering suggests that local environmental conditions provide habitat-specific scenarios for niche requirements, ultimately determining the composition of local communities. In this work, we analyze the spatial variation of microbial communities across environmental gradients of sea surface temperature, salinity and photosynthetically active radiation and spatial distance in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. We hypothesize that environmental filters are the main control of the spatial variation of these communities. Thus, strong relationships between community composition and environmental variation and weak relationships between community composition and spatial distance are expected. Combining physical characterization of the water column, cell counts by flow cytometry, small ribosomal subunit genes fingerprinting and next generation sequencing, we contrast the abundance and composition of photosynthetic eukaryotes and heterotrophic bacterial local communities at a submesoscale. Our results indicate that the strength of the environmental controls differed markedly between eukaryotes and bacterial communities. Whereas eukaryotic photosynthetic assemblages responded weakly to environmental variability, bacteria respond promptly to fine-scale environmental changes in this polar marine system.

AB  - AIM: Geographic, climatic, and soil factors are major drivers of plant beta diversity, but their importance for dryland plant communities is poorly known. This study aims to: i) characterize patterns of beta diversity in global drylands, ii) detect common environmental drivers of beta diversity, and iii) test for thresholds in environmental conditions driving potential shifts in plant species composition. LOCATION: 224 sites in diverse dryland plant communities from 22 geographical regions in six continents. METHODS: Beta diversity was quantified with four complementary measures: the percentage of singletons (species occurring at only one site), Whittake's beta diversity (β(W)), a directional beta diversity metric based on the correlation in species occurrences among spatially contiguous sites (β(R(2))), and a multivariate abundance-based metric (β(MV)). We used linear modelling to quantify the relationships between these metrics of beta diversity and geographic, climatic, and soil variables. RESULTS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall, and to a lesser extent latitude, were the most important environmental predictors of beta diversity. Metrics related to species identity (percentage of singletons and β(W)) were most sensitive to soil fertility, whereas those metrics related to environmental gradients and abundance ((β(R(2))) and β(MV)) were more associated with climate variability. Interactions among soil variables, climatic factors, and plant cover were not important determinants of beta diversity. Sites receiving less than 178 mm of annual rainfall differed sharply in species composition from more mesic sites (> 200 mm). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Soil fertility and variability in temperature and rainfall are the most important environmental predictors of variation in plant beta diversity in global drylands. Our results suggest that those sites annually receiving ∼ 178 mm of rainfall will be especially sensitive to future climate changes. These findings may help to define appropriate conservation strategies for mitigating effects of climate change on dryland vegetation.

AB  - Araucaria araucana (Araucaria) is a long-lived conifer growing along a sharp west–east biophysical gradient in the Patagonian Andes. The patterns and climate drivers of Araucaria growth have typically been documented on the driest part of the gradient relying on correlations with meteorological records, but the lack of in situ soil moisture observations has precluded an assessment of the growth responses to soil moisture variability. Here, we use a network of 21 tree-ring width chronologies to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of tree growth through the entire gradient and evaluate their linkages with regional climate and satellite-observed surface soil moisture variability. We found that temporal variations in tree growth are remarkably similar throughout the gradient and largely driven by soil moisture variability. The regional spatiotemporal pattern of tree growth was positively correlated with precipitation (r = 0.35 for January 1920–1974; P < 0.01) and predominantly negatively correlated with temperature (r = −0.38 for January–March 1920–1974; P < 0.01) during the previous growing season. These correlations suggest a temporally lagged growth response to summer moisture that could be associated with known physiological carry-over processes in conifers and to a response to moisture variability at deeper layers of the rooting zone. Notably, satellite observations revealed a previously unobserved response of Araucaria growth to summer surface soil moisture during the current rather than the previous growing season (r = 0.65 for 1979–2000; P < 0.05). This new response has a large spatial footprint across the mid-latitudes of the South American continent (35°–45°S) and highlights the potential of Araucaria tree rings for palaeoclimatic applications. The strong moisture constraint on tree growth revealed by satellite observations suggests that projected summer drying during the coming decades may result in regional growth declines in Araucaria forests and other water-limited ecosystems in the Patagonian Andes.

AB  - During the last decade, the IUCN has developed criteria analogous to the Red List of Threatened Species to perform similar risk assessment on ecosystems, creating the Red List of Ecosystems methodology. One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is the gathering and availability of the information needed to apply the criteria. We present a complement to the IUCN's methodology to assess the threat level to ecosystems, estimating the spatial and temporal quality of the information available in scientific publications. We did this by applying the IUCN criteria to determine the threat level to the sclerophyll ecosystems of central Chile. Spatially explicit studies that identify disturbances in the structure of the vegetation were selected, making it possible to quantify effectively the reduction in the ecosystems' distribution. The spatial and temporal quality of the assessment were estimated as the percentage of the potential ecosystem distribution and the time frame recommended by the IUCN (50 years), that the studies represented for each ecosystem. The application of the methodology allowed the assessment of a high percentage of the ecosystems (85%), which were classified based on the studies with ranges of temporal quality from 30 to 100% and spatial quality from 12 to 100%. If only the assessments with more than medium spatio-temporal quality are considered (&gt; 50%), eight of the 17 evaluated ecosystems are classified in threat categories, which represents 22.9% of the study area.

AB  - [1] Observations were performed in 12 communities of Central Chile in order to determine the horizontal gradients of ozone in the Santiago Basin and surrounding valleys. Higher ozone mixing ratios were found northeast of the Santiago Basin and included east of the Aconcagua Valley (~70 km from Santiago) suggesting that photochemical pollution produced in Santiago is capable of passing through the Chacabuco mountain chain (~1.3 km) and have impact downwind from the regions with the largest NOx and VOC emissions. To complement existing surface observations, ozonesonde and tethersonde campaigns were performed in the Santiago Basin and the Aconcagua Valley. The results suggest ozone can accumulate in layers aloft (e.g., >102 ppb at 2 km) similarly to layers observed in complex topography coastal regions like Southern California. Layers of significant ozone concentrations having a near surface origin were observed above the mixed layer and below the subsidence inversion base. We propose that the ozone in this residual layer can be transported large distances (at least to 70 km) to further penetrate into the local environment under conditions of a well-mixed boundary layer.

AB  - Aims

Climate and human impacts are changing the nitrogen (N) inputs and losses in terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is largely unknown how these two major drivers of global change will simultaneously influence the N cycle in drylands, the largest terrestrial biome on the planet. We conducted a global observational study to evaluate how aridity and human impacts, together with biotic and abiotic factors, affect key soil variables of the N cycle.


Location

Two hundred and twenty-four dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica widely differing in their environmental conditions and human influence.


Methods

Using a standardized field survey, we measured aridity, human impacts (i.e. proxies of land uses and air pollution), key biophysical variables (i.e. soil pH and texture and total plant cover) and six important variables related to N cycling in soils: total N, organic N, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic:inorganic N and N mineralization rates. We used structural equation modelling to assess the direct and indirect effects of aridity, human impacts and key biophysical variables on the N cycle.


Results

Human impacts increased the concentration of total N, while aridity reduced it. The effects of aridity and human impacts on the N cycle were spatially disconnected, which may favour scarcity of N in the most arid areas and promote its accumulation in the least arid areas.


Main conclusions

We found that increasing aridity and anthropogenic pressure are spatially disconnected in drylands. This implies that while places with low aridity and high human impact accumulate N, most arid sites with the lowest human impacts lose N. Our analyses also provide evidence that both increasing aridity and human impacts may enhance the relative dominance of inorganic N in dryland soils, having a negative impact on key functions and services provided by these ecosystems.

AB  - Air quality networks need revision and optimisation as instruments and network requirements, both scientific and societal, evolve over time. Assessing and optimising the information content of a monitoring network is a non-trivial problem. Here, we introduce a methodology formulated in a variational framework using an air quality model to simulate the dispersion of carbon monoxide (CO) as a passive tracer at the city scale.Weaddress the specific case of adding or removing stations, and the more general situation of optimally distributing a given number of stations in a domain taking into account transport patterns and spatial factors such as population density and emission patterns.Weconsider three quality indicators: precision gain, information gain and degrees of freedom for a signal. These metrics are all functions of the singular values of the sensitivity matrix that links emissions and observations in the variational framework.Weillustrate the application of the methodology in the case of Santiago (33.58S, 70.58W, 500ma.s.l.), a city of ca. 7 million inhabitants with significant pollution levels. Wedeem information gain as the best of the above indicators for this case.Wethen quantify the actual evolution of Santiago’s network and compare it with the optimal configuration suggested by our methodology and with results previously obtained using a statistical approach. The application is restricted to diurnal and summer conditions, for which the dispersion model shows a good agreement with observations. The current method offers advantages in that it allows extending a network to include new sites, and it explicitly considers the effects of dispersion patterns, and desired weighting functions such as emission fluxes and population density. We find that Santiago’s air quality has improved two-fold since 1988, regarding CO under diurnal summer conditions. Still, according to our results, the current configuration could be improved by integrating more suburban stations in the southwest of the basin.

AB  - As rainfall in South-Central Chile has decreased in recent decades, local communities and industries have developed an understandable concern about their threatened water supply. Reconstructing streamflows from tree-ring data has been recognized as a useful paleoclimatic tool in providing long-term perspectives on the temporal characteristics of hydroclimate systems. Multi-century long streamflow reconstructions can be compared to relatively short instrumental observations in order to analyze the frequency of low and high water availability through time. In this work, we have developed a Biobío River streamflow reconstruction to explore the long-term hydroclimate variability at the confluence of the Mediterranean-subtropical and the Temperate-humid climate zones, two regions represented by previous reconstructions of the Maule and Puelo Rivers, respectively. In a suite of analyses, the Biobío River reconstruction proves to be more similar to the Puelo River than the Maule River, despite its closer geographic proximity to the latter. This finding corroborates other studies with instrumental data that identify 37.5°S as a latitudinal confluence of two climate zones. The analyzed rivers are affected by climate forcings on interannual and interdecadal time-scales, Tropical (El Niño Southern Oscillation; ENSO) and Antarctic (Southern Annular Mode; SAM). Longer cycles found, around 80-years, are well correlated only with SAM variation, which explains most of the variance in the Biobío and Puelo rivers. This cycle also has been attributed to orbital forcing by other authors. All three rivers showed an increase in the frequency of extreme high and low flow events in the 20th century. The most extreme dry and wet years in the instrumental record (1943-2000) were not the most extreme of the past 400-years reconstructed for the three rivers (1600-2000), yet both instrumental record years did rank in the five most extreme of the streamflow reconstructions as a whole. These findings suggest a high level of natural variability in the hydro-climatic conditions of the region, where extremes characterized the 20th century. This information is particularly useful when evaluating and improving a wide variety of water management models that apply to water resources that are sensitive to agricultural and hydropower industries.

AB  - The relations between humans and animals extend into socio-cultural aspects that go beyond the mere acquisition of food, meaning that animals constitute cultural resources that fulfill diverse roles in social and cultural systems. Visual images in different media, including rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract, non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete, practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here, based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca. 13,000-410. BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions. In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in the economy of local societies.

AB  - The Atacama Desert has been pointed out as one of the places on earth where the highest surface irradiance may occur. This area is characterized by its high altitude, prevalent cloudless conditions and relatively low columns of ozone and water vapor. Aimed at the characterization of the solar spectrum in the Atacama Desert, we carried out in February-March 2015 ground-based measurements of the spectral irradiance (from the ultraviolet to the near infrared) at seven locations that ranged from the city of Antofagasta (on the southern pacific coastline) to the Chajnantor Plateau (5,100 m altitude). Our spectral measurements allowed us to retrieve the total ozone column, the precipitable water, and the aerosol properties at each location. We found that changes in these parameters, as well as the shorter optical path length at high-altitude locations, lead to significant increases in the surface irradiance with the altitude. Our measurements show that, in the range 0–5100 m altitude, surface irradiance increases with the altitude by about 27% in the infrared range, 6% in the visible range, and 20% in the ultraviolet range. Spectral measurements carried out at the Izaña Observatory (Tenerife, Spain), in Hannover (Germany) and in Santiago (Chile), were used for further comparisons.

AB  - Two Holocene tephras encountered in outcrops, cores and trenches in bogs, and lake cores in the area around Cochrane, southern Chile, are identified (based on their age, tephra glass color and morphology, mineralogy, and both bulk and glass chemistry) as H1 derived from Hudson volcano, and MEN1 derived from Mentolat volcano.
New AMS radiocarbon ages indicate systematic differences between those determined in lake cores (MEN1=7,689 and H1=8,440 cal yrs BP) and surface deposits (MEN1=7,471 and H1=7,891 cal yrs BP), with the lake cores being somewhat older. H1 tephra layers range from 8 to 18 cm thick, suggesting that both the area of the 10 cm isopach and the volume of this eruption were larger than previously suggested, but not greatly, and that the direction of maximum dispersion was more to the south. MEN1 tephra layers range from 1-4 cm in thickness, indicating that this was probably a reasonably large (>5 km 3 ) eruption. Some of the lake cores also contain thin layers (<2 cm) of late Holocene H2 tephra and the recent H3 (1991 AD) tephra, both derived from the Hudson volcano. No tephra evidence has been observed for any late Pleistocene tephra, nor for the existence of the supposed Arenales volcano, proposed to be located west of Cochrane.

T2  - Quaternary Science Reviews
AB  - We present a detailed record from Lago Pichilafquén to unravel the vegetation, climate and disturbance history of the lowlands of northwestern Patagonia (40°S) since 14,500calyrBP. The presence of 30 tephras throughout the record attest for the proximity of the site to active volcanic centres and allows assessment of the role of volcanic disturbance on past vegetation and fire regime shifts. We interpretalternations in dominance between North Patagonian and Valdivian rainforests driven by changes in temperature and precipitation of westerly origin at multi-millennial and millennial timescales. These trends were punctuated by centennial-scale changes, most of which were coeval with or immediately followed the deposition of tephras and/or paleofires. We identify departures of the local vegetation from the regional trend between 2400 and 7100calyrBP, which we interpret as a response of rainforest vegetation and local fire regimes to the disturbance effect of tephra deposition near Lago Pichilafquén. We also find that volcanic disturbance promoted consistent increases in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia within 30 years and paleofires between 60 and 120years following tephra deposition. Comparisons with palynological records having similar span, time resolution and age control suggest that regional climate has played a central role on the establishment, composition and maintenance of temperate rainforests. This influence is overprinted by disturbance regimes at the local and landscape level, driving divergences and heterogeneity especially at times of relatively weak climatic forcing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Within large uncertainties in the precipitation response to greenhouse gas forcing, the Southeast Pacific drying stands out as a robust signature within climate models. A precipitation decline, of consistent direction but of larger amplitude than obtained in simulations with historical climate forcing, has been observed in central Chile since the late 1970s. To attribute the causes of this trend, we analyze local rain gauge data and contrast them to a large ensemble of both fully coupled and sea surface temperature-forced simulations. We show that in concomitance with large-scale circulation changes, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation explains about half of the precipitation trend observed in central Chile. The remaining fraction is unlikely to be driven exclusively by natural phenomena but rather consistent with the simulated regional effect of anthropogenic climate change. We particularly estimate that a quarter of the rainfall deficit affecting this region since 2010 is of anthropogenic origin. An increased persistence and recurrence of droughts in central Chile emerges then as a realistic scenario under the current socioeconomic pathway.

AB  - The winter time weather variability over the Mediterranean is studied in relation to the prevailing weather regimes (WRs) over the region. Using daily geopotential heights at 700 hPa from the ECMWF ERA40 Reanalysis Project and Cluster Analysis, four WRs are identified, in increasing order of frequency of occurrence, as cyclonic (22.0 %), zonal (24.8 %), meridional (25.2 %) and anticyclonic (28.0 %). The surface climate, cloud distribution and radiation patterns associated with these winter WRs are deduced from satellite (ISCCP) and other observational (E-OBS, ERA40) datasets. The LMDz atmosphere–ocean regional climate model is able to simulate successfully the same four Mediterranean weather regimes and reproduce the associated surface and atmospheric conditions for the present climate (1961–1990). Both observational- and LMDz-based computations show that the four Mediterranean weather regimes control the region’s weather and climate conditions during winter, exhibiting significant differences between them as for temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and radiation distributions within the region. Projections (2021–2050) of the winter Mediterranean weather and climate are obtained using the LMDz model and analysed in relation to the simulated changes in the four WRs. According to the SRES A1B emission scenario, a significant warming (between 2 and 4 °C) is projected to occur in the region, along with a precipitation decrease by 10–20 % in southern Europe, Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, against a 10 % precipitation increase in northern European areas. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation in the Mediterranean are explained by the model-predicted changes in the frequency of occurrence as well as in the intra-seasonal variability of the regional weather regimes. The anticyclonic configuration is projected to become more recurrent, contributing to the decreased precipitation over most of the basin, while the cyclonic and zonal ones become more sporadic, resulting in more days with below normal precipitation over most of the basin, and on the eastern part of the region, respectively. The changes in frequency and intra-seasonal variability highlights the usefulness of dynamics versus statistical downscaling techniques for climate change studies.

AB  - Cyanobacteria from Subsection V (Stigonematales) are important components of microbial mats in non-acidic terrestrial hot springs. Despite their diazotrophic nature (N2 fixers), their impact on the nitrogen cycle in such extreme ecosystems remains unknown. Here, we surveyed the identity and activity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the neutral hot spring of Porcelana (Northern Patagonia, Chile) during 2009 and 2011-2013. We used 16S rRNA and the nifH gene to analyze the distribution and diversity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the dominance of the heterocystous genus Mastigocladus (Stigonematales) along the entire temperature gradient of the hot spring (69-38 °C). In situ nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction), nitrogen fixation rates (cellular uptake of (15)N2) and nifH transcription levels in the microbial mats showed that nitrogen fixation and nifH mRNA expression were light-dependent. Nitrogen fixation activities were detected at temperatures ranging from 58 °C to 46 °C, with maximum daily rates of 600 nmol C2H4 cm(-2) per day and 94.1 nmol N cm(-2) per day. These activity patterns strongly suggest a heterocystous cyanobacterial origin and reveal a correlation between nitrogenase activity and nifH gene expression during diurnal cycles in thermal microbial mats. N and C fixation in the mats contributed ∼3 g N m(-2) per year and 27 g C m(-2) per year, suggesting that these vital demands are fully met by the diazotrophic and photoautotrophic capacities of the cyanobacteria in the Porcelana hot spring.

AB  - The vulnerability of Amazonian rainforest, and the ecological services it provides, depends on an adequate supply of dry-season water, either as precipitation or stored soil moisture. How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario. We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends, the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy - savannah-prone - dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the â € model democracy'view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres
AB  - The emission of mineral dust aerosols in arid and semiarid regions is a complex process whose representation in atmospheric models remains crude, due to insufficient knowledge about the aerosol lifting process itself, the lack of global data on soil characteristics, and the impossibility for the models to resolve the fine-scale variability in the wind field that drives some of the dust events. As a result, there are large uncertainties in the total emission flux of mineral dust, its natural variability at various timescales, and the possible contribution from anthropogenic land use changes. This work aims for estimating dust emissions and reduces their uncertainty over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula—the largest dust source region of the globe. We use a data assimilation approach to constrain dust emission fluxes at a monthly resolution for 18 subregions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-derived aerosol optical depth is assimilated in a regional configuration of a general circulation model coupled to an aerosol model. We describe this data assimilation system and apply it for 1 year, resulting in a total mineral dust emissions flux estimate of 2900 Tg yr−1 over the Sahara desert and the Arabian Peninsula for the year 2006. The analysis field of aerosol optical depth shows an improved fit relative to independent Aerosol Robotic Network measurements as compared to the model prior field.

With extensive paleo-wetlands and groundwater-fed oases, the Atacama Desert was interspersed with riparian woodlands that provided vital resources (fuel, water, and game) at the end of the Pleistocene in areas such as the Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) basin. We use anthracological analyses to determine the fuel management strategies of hunter-gatherer societies in this hyperarid environment and explore whether the “Principle of Least Effort” applies. First, we present the combustion qualities and characteristics of woody taxa from the Atacama and analyze possible exploitation strategies. Second, we use anthracological analyses from Quebrada Maní 12 (QM12), a late Pleistocene archaeological site (dated from 12,750 to 11,530 cal B.P.) located in the PdT basin, to show the prevalence of two woody species that were either freshly collected or gathered (very likely on purpose) from subfossil wood. Our results suggest that fuel selection strategies were based on prior knowledge of the qualities of these woody taxa and how they burned. Thus we conclude that fuel management was part of a number of social and economic decisions that allowed for effective colonization of this region. Furthermore, we stress the need for caution when using charcoal to exclusively date archaeological sites located in desert environments.

Las sociedades de cazadores-recolectores del Cono Sur recolectaron y utilizaron diversas especies leñosas dependiendo de las condiciones del paisaje, las comunidades de plantas disponibles y consideraciones socio-culturales. Las cuencas hidrográficas, como Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) en el Desierto de Atacama, contaban con extensos paleo-humedales y oasis sustentados con aguas subterráneas, intercalados con bosques ribereños que proporcionaron recursos vitales (combustible, agua y caza) hacia finales del Pleistoceno. Este estudio utiliza análisis antracológicos para definir las estrategias empleadas por los grupos de cazadores-recolectores para la gestión del combustible en este ambiente híper árido y explorar si dicho comportamiento social puede ser explicado por el “principio del menor esfuerzo”. En primer lugar, se presentan las cualidades y características de quema de los taxones leñosos del Desierto de Atacama y un análisis de sus estrategias de explotación. En segundo lugar, se utilizan los resultados de análisis antracológicos de muestras de carbones y maderas del sitio arqueológico Quebrada Maní 12 (QM12), ubicado en la PdT y asignado al Pleistoceno tardío (datado entre 12.750 y 11.530 cal a.P.). Estos muestran un predominio de dos especies leñosas recogidas como madera fresca ocolectadas, posiblemente en forma intencional, como “madera vieja”. Los resultados revelan que las estrategias de selección del material para la combustión requirieron de un conocimiento previo acerca de cómo se quemaban los taxones leñosos. Consecuentemente, se concluye que la gestión del combustible formó parte de las decisiones sociales y económicas que permitieron una colonización efectiva de esta región. Finalmente, se señala la necesidad de cautela a la hora de interpretar las cronologías arqueológicas basadas exclusivamente en dataciones sobre carbón en sitios ubicados en desiertos.

AB  - The Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is a key player in global-scale oceanic overturning processes and an important conduit for heat, fresh water, and carbon transport. The AAIW past variability is poorly understood mainly due to the lack of sedimentary archives at intermediate water depths. We present records of benthic stable isotopes from sediments retrieved with the seafloor drill rig MARUM-MeBo at 956 m water depth off northern Chile (GeoB15016, 27°29.48′S, 71°07.58′W) that extend back to 970 ka. The sediments at this site are presently deposited at the boundary between AAIW and Pacific Deep Water (PDW). For previous peak interglacials, our results reveal similar benthic δ13C values at site GeoB15016 and of a newly generated stack of benthic δ13C from various deep Pacific cores representing the "average PDW." This suggests, unlike today, the absence of AAIW at the site and the presence of nearly pure PDW. In contrast, more positive δ13C values at site GeoB15016 compared to the stack imply a considerable AAIW contribution during cold phases of interglacials and especially during glacials. Besides, we used three short sediment cores to reconstruct benthic δ13C values from the AAIW core during the last glacial and found a δ13C signature similar to today's. Assuming that this was the case also for the past 970 kyr, we demonstrate that sea level changes and latitudinal migrations of the AAIW formation site can only account for about 50% of the full range of past δ13C increases at site GeoB15016 during cold periods. Other processes that could explain the remaining of the positive δ13C anomalies are increases in glacial AAIW production and/or deeper convection of the AAIW with respect to preceding interglacials. Key Points Absence of AAIW off northern Chile during past peak interglacial periods Increase advection of AAIW to the northern Chilean margin during cold periods Present and LGM AAIW production similar and the highest since 970 ka ©2013.

AB  - On the basis of 8-years (2005-2012) of stroke data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network we describe the spatial distribution and temporal variability of lightning activity over Western Patagonia. This region extends from ∼40°S to 55°S along the west coast of South America, is limited to the east by the austral Andes, and features a hyper-humid, maritime climate. Stroke density exhibits a sharp maximum along the coast of southern Chile. Although precipitation there is largely produced by cold nimbostratus, days with more than one stroke occur up to a third of the time somewhere along the coastal strip. Disperse strokes are also observed off southern Chile. In contrast, strokes are virtually nonexistent over the austral Andes - where precipitation is maximum - and farther east over the dry lowlands of Argentina. Atmospheric reanalysis and satellite imagery are used to characterize the synoptic environment of lightning-producing storms, exemplified by a case study and generalized by a compositing analysis. Lightning activity tends to occur when Western Patagonia is immersed in a pool of cold air behind a front that has reached the coast at ∼40°S. Under these circumstances, midlevel cooling occurs before and is more prominent than near-surface cooling, leading to a weakly unstable postfrontal condition. Forced uplift of the strong westerlies impinging on the coastal mountains can trigger convection and produces significant lightning activity in this zone. Farther offshore, large-scale ascent near the cyclone's center may lift near-surface air parcels, fostering shallow convection and dispersing lightning activity. Key Points Significant lightning activity occurs in Western Patagonia Lightning storms develop under a cold, weakly unstable postfrontal condition Topography and ocean conditions favor lightning activity in Western Patagonia. © 2014.

AB  - Considering the role that higher education institutions (HEIs) play in terms of catalysing change within societies, over the past years, sustainability initiatives within HEIs have flourished worldwide. Likewise, the scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change has been on the political and academic agenda for decades, thus, the importance of ameliorating climate change education and literacy both at the society and university training levels. Accordingly, certain questions arise: What are the most effective current climate change educational methodologies? Which road map would be the most appropriate to be suggested to HEIs to promote climate change literacy for future professionals? In order to begin addressing these questions, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences of the University of Chile (FCFM) approach to climate change teaching and literacy is here described. The later contemplates the history of the institutionalisation of sustainability at the FCFM, collection of courses and minors for students which incorporate climate change related-topics, as well as climate change related research centres.

AB  - South America is experiencing rapid change in forest cover, of both native and planted forest. Forest cover loss is primarily attributable to fire, logging, and conversion of native forest to agriculture, pasture, and forest plantations, and types of change vary within and among the many diverse types of forests in South America. Major changes in forest cover and growing policy concerns underscore an urgent need for research on sustainable forest management and water ecosystem services in South America. Differences in land ownership and management objectives create trade-offs between wood production and water ecosystem services from forests. Work is needed to quantify how forest change and management affect ecosystem services, such as wood production versus water provision. Current scientific understanding of forest management effects on water ecosystem services in South America has important limitations, including a scarcity of long-term records and few long-term integrated watershed studies. Industry, government, universities, and local communities should collaborate on integrated applied studies of forests and water. Data archiving and publically available data are required. The creation of national networks and a multi-country South America network to identify and implement common water research protocols, share results, and explore their implications would promote common and well-supported policies. Hydrologists working in South America are well placed to tackle the challenges and opportunities for collaborative research that will maintain the intrinsic values and water ecosystem services provided by South America's forests.

AB  - The significance and cause of the decline in biomass burning across the Americas after ad 1500 is a topic of considerable debate. We synthesized charcoal records (a proxy for biomass burning) from the Americas and from the remainder of the globe over the past 2000 years, and compared these with paleoclimatic records and population reconstructions. A distinct post-ad 1500 decrease in biomass burning is evident, not only in the Americas, but also globally, and both are similar in duration and timing to ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change. There is temporal and spatial variability in the expression of the biomass-burning decline across the Americas but, at a regional–continental scale, ‘Little Ice Age’ climate change was likely more important than indigenous population collapse in driving this decline.

T2  - Andean Geology
AB  - The 2008-2009 eruption of Chaitén Volcano (Chile) involved a variety of volcanic and associated hydrologic processes that damaged nearby forests. These processes included coarse (gravel) and fine (silt to sand) tephra fall, a laterally directed blast, fluvial deposition of remobilized tephra, a variety of low-temperature mass-movement processes, and a pyroclastic flow. Each of these geophysical processes constitutes a type of ecosystem disturbance which involves a distinctive suite of disturbance mechanisms, namely burial by tephra and sediment, heating, abrasion, impact force, and canopy loading (accumulation of tephra in tree crowns). Each process affected specific areas, and created patches and disturbance gradients in the forest landscape. Coarse tephra (‘gravel rain’, >5 cm depth) abraded foliage from tree canopies over an area of approximately 50 km2 north-northeast of the vent. Fine tephra (>10 cm depth) accumulated in tree crowns and led to breakage of branches in old forest and bowing of flexible, young trees over an area of about 480 km2. A directed blast down the north flank of the volcano damaged forest over an area of 4 km2. This blast zone included an area of tree removal near the crater rim, toppled forest farther down the slope, and standing, scorched forest around the blast perimeter. Fluvial deposition of >100 cm of remobilized tephra, beginning about 10 days after initiation of the eruption, buried floodplain forest in distinct, elongate streamside patches covering 5 km2 of the lower 19 km of the Rayas River and several km2 of the lower Chaitén River. Across this array of disturbance processes the fate of affected trees varied from complete mortality in the tree removal and pyroclastic flow areas, to no mortality in areas of thin tephra fall deposits. Tree damage included defoliation, loss of branches, snapping of tree trunks, abrasion of bark and ephiphytes, and uprooting. Damaged trees sprouted from epicormic buds located in trunks and branches, but sprouting varied over time among disturbance mechanisms and species. Although some effects of the Chaitén eruption are very similar to those from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (USA), interactions between biota and geophysical processes at Chaitén produced some unique effects. Examination of vegetation response helps interpret geophysical processes, and disturbance mechanisms influence early stages of biotic response to an eruption.

T2  - Journal of Climate
AB  - Patagonia, located in southern South America, is a vast and remote region holding a rich variety of past environmental records but a small number of meteorological stations. Precipitation over this region is mostly produced by disturbances embedded in the westerly flow and is strongly modified by the austral Andes. Uplift on the windward side leads to hyperhumid conditions along the Pacific coast and the western slope of the Andes; in contrast, downslope subsidence dries the eastern plains leading to arid, highly evaporative conditions.The authors investigate the dependence of Patagonia’s local climate (precipitation and near-surface air temperature) year-to-year variability on large-scale circulation anomalies using results from a 30-yr-long high-resolution numerical simulation. Variations of the low-level zonal wind account for a large fraction of the rainfall variability at synoptic and interannual time scales. Zonal wind also controls the amplitude of the air temperature annual cycle by changing the intensity of the seasonally varying temperature advection.The main modes of year-to-year variability of the zonal flow over southern South America are also investigated. Year round there is a dipole between mid- and high latitudes. The node separating wind anomalies of opposite sign migrates through the seasons, leading to a dipole over Patagonia during austral summer and a monopole during winter. Reanalysis data also suggests that westerly flow has mostly decreased over north-central Patagonia during the last four decades, causing a drying trend to the west of the Andes, but a modest increase is exhibited over the southern tip of the continent.

AB  - Late twentieth-century instrumental records reveal a persistent southward shift of the Southern Westerly Winds during austral summer and autumn associated with a positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and contemporaneous with glacial recession, steady increases in atmospheric temperatures and CO2 concentrations at a global scale. However, despite the clear importance of the SAM in the modern/future climate, very little is known regarding its behaviour during pre-Industrial times. Here we present a stratigraphic record from Lago Cipreses (51°S), southwestern Patagonia, that reveals recurrent ∼200-year long dry/warm phases over the last three millennia, which we interpret as positive SAM-like states. These correspond in timing with the Industrial revolution, the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly, the Roman and Late Bronze Age Warm Periods and alternate with cold/wet multi-centennial phases in European palaeoclimate records. We conclude that SAM-like changes at centennial timescales in southwestern Patagonia represent in-phase interhemispheric coupling of palaeoclimate over the last 3,000 years through atmospheric teleconnections.

AB  - The concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) and methane (CH<inf>4</inf>), were measured in the Kerguelen Plateau region (KPR). The KPR is affected by an annual microalgal bloom caused by natural iron fertilization, and this may stimulate the microbes involved in GHG cycling. This study was carried out during the KEOPS 2 cruise during the austral spring of 2011. Oceanographic variables, including N2O and CH4, were sampled (from the surface to 500 m depth) in two transects along and across the KRP, the north-south (TNS) transect (46°-51° S, ∼ 72° E) and the east-west (TEW) transect (66°-75° E, ∼ 48.3° S), both associated with the presence of a plateau, polar front (PF) and other mesoscale features. The TEW presented N<inf>2</inf>O levels ranging from equilibrium (105%) to slightly supersaturated (120%) with respect to the atmosphere, whereas CH<inf>4</inf> levels fluctuated dramatically, being highly supersaturated (120-970%) in areas close to the coastal waters of the Kerguelen Islands and in the PF. The TNS showed a more homogenous distribution for both gases, with N<inf>2</inf>O and CH<inf>4</inf> levels ranging from 88 to 171% and 45 to 666% saturation, respectively. Surface CH4 peaked at southeastern stations of the KPR (A3 stations), where a phytoplankton bloom was observed. Both gases responded significantly, but in contrasting ways (CH<inf>4</inf> accumulation and N<inf>2</inf>O depletion), to the patchy distribution of chlorophyll a. This seems to be associated to the supply of iron from various sources. Air-sea fluxes for N<inf>2</inf>O (from -10.5 to 8.65, mean 1.25 ± 4.04 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and for CH<inf>4</inf> (from 0.32 to 38.1, mean 10.01 ± 9.97 μmol<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) indicated that the KPR is both a sink and a source for N<inf>2</inf>O, as well as a considerable and variable source of CH<inf>4</inf>. This appears to be associated with biological factors, as well as the transport of water masses enriched with Fe and CH<inf>4</inf> from the coastal area of the Kerguelen Islands. These previously unreported results for the Southern Ocean suggest an intense microbial CH<inf>4</inf> production in the study area.

AB  - The 2011 eruption in the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex deposited up to 50 cm of tephra in a plume that intersected the crest of the Andes along Route 215, offering an excellent opportunity to study disturbance effects on native forests along a gradient of tephra depth. Our observations focused on short-term, species-level, tree mortality and sprouting and tephra fall effects on foliage and limb fall. More than 80 % of the thickest deposits were composed of a basal, pumice, gravel layer containing individual clasts up to 6 cm in length overlain by finer gravel and capped by several cm of sandy tephra. In a sample of four plots with tephra thickness ranging from 10 to 50 cm, we observed a wide range of tree mortality: about 8 % of stems living at the time of the eruption were killed by 10 cm of tephra fall and 54 % were killed by 50 cm. However, properties of the affected forest, such as species composition, foliage sprouting and retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics, and tree size/age, strongly influenced survival. The sites with 35 and 50 cm thick deposits were dominated by the deciduous tree Nothofagus pumilio, which was leafless in the austral winter, season of the initial phase of the eruption. The evergreen tree N. dombeyi experienced much higher mortality. The low density of the falling pumice particles appeared to cause minimal abrasion of the canopy.

AB  - To better forecast streamflow and water resource availability, it is important to have an understanding of the meteorological drivers of the orographic precipitation gradient (OPG), especially critical in semiarid mountainous areas. Although forced ascent over topography typically results in precipitation increasing with altitude (positive OPGs), mean annual OPGs and especially OPGs associated with individual storms can change widely in magnitude and even sign. Precipitation measurements from the Elqui Valley in the semiarid Andes of Chile (30°S) reveal a mean annual OPG of 6.3 mm km−1 (millimeters of precipitation over kilometers in elevation) ranging from −42 to 52 mm km−1 for individual storms over the last 35 years (1979–2013). Reanalysis data and precipitation measurements are used to characterize the observed OPG in this region in relation with their synoptic-scale flow. It is found that the Froude number correlates positively with the OPG, reflecting stronger zonal winds and less static stability during storms that have positive OPGs. Altitude of the Andes barrier jet shows only a weak relationship with the OPG. Significant storms with positive OPGs are typically linked with an austral blocking of the westerlies and an equatorward migration of the midlatitude storm track. For negative OPGs, either a cutoff low or the northern edge of a surface migratory cyclone reaches the Elqui Valley in such a way that significant rainfall only occurs in the near-coastal region without major snowfall accumulation over the Andes.

AB  - Megacities are not only important drivers for socio-economic development but also sources of environmental challenges. Many megacities and large urban agglomerations are located in the coastal zone where land, atmosphere, and ocean meet, posing multiple environmental challenges which we consider here. The atmospheric flow around megacities is complicated by urban heat island effects and topographic flows and sea breezes and influences air pollution and human health. The outflow of polluted air over the ocean perturbs biogeochemical processes. Contaminant inputs can damage downstream coastal zone ecosystem function and resources including fisheries, induce harmful algal blooms and feedback to the atmosphere via marine emissions. The scale of influence of megacities in the coastal zone is hundreds to thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere and tens to hundreds of kilometers in the ocean. We list research needs to further our understanding of coastal megacities with the ultimate aim to improve their environmental management.

AB  - We explore the relationship between satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface aerosol mass concentrations over a subtropical urban area, namely, Santiago, Chile (33.5°S, 70.6°W, 500 m.a.s.l.). We compare 11 years of AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with in situ particulate matter mass concentrations (PM). MODIS AOD reaches its maximum in summer and minimum in winter, the opposite of the annual cycle of surface PM. To improve our understanding of the relevant governing processes, we use a simple model that estimates the boundary layer (BL) AOD based on measured PM, relative humidity and BL height (BLH) as well as best estimates of aerosol composition, size distribution, and optical properties. Model results indicate that a weak annual AOD cycle is due to the opposite annual cycles in BLH and PM, which is largely supported by the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data collected in 2001 and 2002 in Santiago. We identify a possible bias linked to the operational estimate of surface reflectance that may lead to a spurious summer maximum in MODIS AOD over Santiago. This misfit in surface reflectance appears to affect not only Santiago but also a significant area of the semi-arid Southern South America. Sensitivity experiments with the simple model indicate an underestimate of simulated AOD as compared to AERONET data. This underestimate points to the possible role of residual aerosol layers in the AOD measured at the surface (not included in the simple model). Cirrus clouds appear not to play a significant role in explaining the MODIS AOD seasonality. The need for improved characterizations of aerosol properties and their temporal and spatial distribution in cities such as Santiago is emphasized.

While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1σ model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO. ©2015.

AB  - Despite the great number and variety of glaciers in southern South America, in situ glacier mass-balance records are extremely scarce and glacier–climate relationships are still poorly understood in this region. Here we use the longest (>  35 years) and most complete in situ mass-balance record, available for the Echaurren Norte glacier (ECH) in the Andes at  ∼  33.5° S, to develop a minimal glacier surface mass-balance model that relies on nearby monthly precipitation and air temperature data as forcing. This basic model is able to explain 78 % of the variance in the annual glacier mass-balance record over the 1978–2013 calibration period. An attribution assessment identified precipitation variability as the dominant forcing modulating annual mass balances at ECH, with temperature variations likely playing a secondary role. A regionally averaged series of mean annual streamflow records from both sides of the Andes between  ∼  30 and 37° S is then used to estimate, through simple linear regression, this glacier's annual mass-balance variations since 1909. The reconstruction model captures 68 % of the observed glacier mass-balance variability and shows three periods of sustained positive mass balances embedded in an overall negative trend over the past 105 years. The three periods of sustained positive mass balances (centered in the 1920s–1930s, in the 1980s and in the first decade of the 21st century) coincide with several documented glacier advances in this region. Similar trends observed in other shorter glacier mass-balance series suggest that the Echaurren Norte glacier reconstruction is representative of larger-scale conditions and could be useful for more detailed glaciological, hydrological and climatological assessments in this portion of the Andes.

AB  - Within the earth’s atmosphere, methane (CH4) is one of the most important absorbers of infrared energy. It is recognized that coastal areas contribute higher amounts of CH4 emission; however, there is a lack of accurate estimates for these areas. This is particularly evident within the extensive northern fjord region of Chilean Patagonia, which has one of the highest freshwater runoffs in the world. Oceanographic and biogeochemical variables were analyzed between the Reloncaví fjord (41° S) and the Interior Sea of Chiloé (ISC) (43° S), during the 2013 austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the fjord influences salinity distribution, which clearly delimits the surface (<5 m depth) and subsurface layers (>5 m depth), and also separates the estuarine area from the marine area. In the estuary, the highest CH4 levels are generally observed in the cold and brackish nutrient-depleted surface waters (N- and P-depleted), ranging from 16.97 to 151.4 nM (mean ± SD 52.20 ± 46.49), equivalent to 640–4537% saturation except for the case of Si(OH)4. Conversely, subsurface waters have lower CH4 levels, fluctuating from 14.3 to 29.6 nM (mean ± SD 22.75 ± 4.36 nM) or 552–1087% saturation. A significant negative correlation was observed between salinity and CH4, and a positive correlation between Si(OH)4 and CH4, suggesting that some of the CH4 in estuarine water is due to continental runoff. Furthermore, the accumulation of seston and/or plankton at the pycnocline may potentially generate the accumulation of CH4 via microbial processes, as observed in estuarine waters. By contrast, the marine area (the ISC), which is predominantly made up of modified subantarctic water, has a relatively homogenous CH4 distribution (mean ± SD 9.84 ± 6.20 nM). In comparison with other estuaries, the Reloncaví fjord is a moderate source of CH4 to the atmosphere, with effluxes ranging from 23.9 to 136 μmol m−2 day−1. This is almost double the levels observed in the ISC, which ranges from 22.2 to 46.6 μmol m−2 day−1. Considering that Chilean Patagonia has numerous other fjord systems that are geomorphologically alike, and in some cases have much greater freshwater discharge, this study highlights their potential to be a significant natural source of this greenhouse gas.

AB  - Episodic air quality degradation due to particles occurs in multiple cities in central and southern Chile during the austral winter reaching levels up to 300–800 µg/m3 hourly PM2.5, which can be associated with severe effects on human health. An air quality prediction system is developed to predict such events in near real time up to 3 days in advance for nine cities with regular air quality monitoring: Santiago, Rancagua, Curicó, Talca, Chillan, Los Ángeles, Temuco, Valdivia, and Osorno. The system uses the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model configured with a nested 2 km grid-spacing domain to predict weather and inert tracers. The tracers are converted to hourly PM2.5 concentrations using an observationally based calibration which is substantially less computationally intensive than a full chemistry model. The conversion takes into account processes occurring in these cities, including higher likelihood of episode occurrence during weekends and during colder days, the latter related to increased wood-burning-stove activity for heating. The system is calibrated and evaluated for April–August 2014 where it has an overall skill of 53–72% of episodes accurately forecasted (61–76% for the best initialization) which is better than persistence for most stations. Forecasts one, two, and three days in advance all have skill in forecasting events but often present large variability within them due to different meteorological initializations. The system is being implemented in Chile to assist authority decisions not only to warn the population but also to take contingency-based emission restrictions to try to avoid severe pollution events.

AB  - Developing spatially resolved high-resolution datasets of robust long-term changes in human demography constitutes a major challenge for archaeology. One approach is to use the distribution of summed radiocarbon-age probabilities to infer long-term population dynamics (i.e. palaeodemography). However, these can often be biased by preservation potential, site taphonomy or researcher priorities among other aspects, all of which require large datasets to resolve adequately. For this report, we have created such a dataset for the South-Central Andes (16°-25°S), here termed the South Central Andes Radiocarbon (SCAR) database. SCAR spans the last 15,000 years and incorporates ∼1700 14C-dates from 519 archeological sites reported across an extreme bioclimatic gradient that includes the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert and adjacent cold, high-elevation Altiplano. Among the possible methodological biases, we first evaluated those related to calibration procedures. Otherwise, changes in summed probability curves show no other relevant biases except for possible research interest/priorities that could be responsible for the gaps in the record from the Bolivian altiplano. Our temporally continuous time-series indicates that prehispanic populations exhibited significant demographic changes during the last 13,100calBP. Except for coastal populations; most regions show strongly coordinated demographic fluctuations that follow the same major patterns. Thus, we identified two broad scale population events across the South-Central Andes (Atacama inland, Bolivian Altiplano) from 13,100-4000calBP and then from 4000calBP to the present. In contrast, the Atacama coastal records suggest a different and more variable occupation pattern over the last 13,460calBP, which could be driven by the interaction with oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling). A widespread major decline at 700calBP clearly predates the Spanish colonization and occurs in all of our regions. This widespread decline does not appear to be due to methodological biases, and suggests that a population crash occurred before European occupation. Overall, the SCAR database constitutes a valuable proxy for establishing the long-term dynamics of prehistoric societies that inhabited the western Andean slope. Time-series analyses that use SCAR will shed new light on the demographic and cultural dynamics at different spatial-scales, and help clarify the processes involved in the migrational trajectories and cultural evolution of the peoples that inhabited the South-Central Andes over the last 15,000 years.

AB  - Cold-water coral ecosystems present common carbonate factories along the Atlantic continental margins, where they can form large reef structures. There is increasing knowledge on their ecology, molecular genetics, environmental controls and threats available. However, information on their carbo-nate production and accumulation is still very limited, even though this information is essential for their evaluation as carbonate sinks. The aim of this study is to provide high-resolution reef aggradation and carbonate accumulation rates for Norwegian cold-water coral reefs from various settings (sunds, inner shelf and shelf margin). Furthermore, it introduces a new approach for the evaluation of the cold-water coral preservation within cold-water coral deposits by computed tomography analysis. This approach allows the differentiation of various kinds of cold-water coral deposits by their macrofossil clast size and orientation signature. The obtained results suggest that preservation of cold-water coral frameworks in living position is favoured by high reef aggradation rates, while preservation of coral rubble prevails by moderate aggradation rates. A high degree of macrofossil fragmentation indicates condensed intervals or unconformities. The observed aggradation rates with up to 1500 cm kyr−1 exhibit the highest rates from cold-water coral reefs so far. Reef aggradation within the studied cores was restricted to the Early and Late Holocene. Available datings of Norwegian cold-water corals support this age pattern for other fjords while, on the shelf, cold-water coral ages are reported additionally from the early Middle Holocene. The obtained mean carbonate accumulation rates of up to 103 g cm−2 kyr−1 exceed previous estimates of cold-water coral reefs by a factor of two to three and by almost one order of magnitude to adjacent sedimentary environments (shelf, slope and deep sea). Only fjord basins locally exhibit carbonate accumulation rates in the range of the cold-water coral reefs. Furthermore, cold-water coral reef carbonate accumulation rates are in the range of tropical reef carbonate accumulation rates. These results clearly suggest the importance of cold-water coral reefs as local, maybe regional to global, carbonate sinks.

TI  - A synoptic climatology of the near-surface wind along the west coast of South America
AU  - Rahn, David A.
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - Prevailing wind along the west coast of South America is equatorward, driven by the southeast Pacific anticyclone. The wind induces strong coastal upwelling that supports one of the most important fisheries in the world. This region lacks a dense network of in situ observations, so the high resolution (0.313°) NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis is used here to present a synoptic climatology of the coastal wind along the Chile/Peru coast. Covariability between the alongshore pressure gradient and alongshore wind, which was previously identified for synoptic time scales near central Chile, is generalized for the whole coast and over annual time scales. Particular attention is paid to three prominent upwelling regions: Pisco (14.8°S), Punta Lengua de Vaca (30.0°S), and Punta Lavapie (36.4°S). Previous work has identified local maxima at these points but these are embedded in a broader low-level jet that exhibits a marked seasonal cycle of strong wind days due to the migration of the anticyclone and is associated with a shift of both the mean wind and a more frequent recurrence of strong wind events. Alongshore wind near Pisco is normally distributed year-round with a seasonal shift in the mean. Larger variability in the mean and distribution is found at Lavapie, associated with the seasonal change in storm tracks. The synoptic evolution that drives high-wind events at each location is characterized. A midlevel trough and surface cyclone precede wind maxima at each location and are followed by strong midlevel ridging and a strengthened surface anticyclone.

T2  - Computers & Fluids
AB  - This paper, first of a two-part work, presents an overview of the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver in OpenFOAM platform to simulate the internal ventilation regime within an open pit including the effects of developed turbulence, buoyancy and stratification. To incorporate the effect of stratification in the simulations we have chosen a formulation that includes density as a variable in the system of equations, thus facilitating further study of buoyant flows. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to incorporate it in the calculation, using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach to solve the flow near walls. Specific initial and boundary conditions were defined.

The results presented in this paper, including several tests of the solver where we compared our results with experimental or numerical data, have demonstrated the validity of using OpenFOAM to study this type of complex multiphysics problems. Especially advantageous in this regard are the flexibility provided by the modular structure of the code, the possibility of defining specific boundary and initial conditions for each case, and the ability of generating detailed meshes of complex geometries. Also we probed the benefits of using a DES approach, allowing us to solve developed turbulence and the interaction of the flow with detailed geometry. A second paper associated to this work will expose the application of the solver to large open pit mines, simulating the particular case of Chuquicamata, one of the largest open pit mines in the world, located in northern Chile.

AB  - Accurate representation of the real spatio-temporal variability of catchment rainfall inputs is currently severely limited. Moreover, spatially interpolated catchment precipitation is subject to large uncertainties, particularly in developing countries and regions which are difficult to access. Recently, satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for a wide range of hydrological applications, from water resources modelling to monitoring of extreme events such as droughts and floods.This study attempts to exhaustively evaluate – for the first time – the suitability of seven state-of-the-art SRE products (TMPA 3B42v7, CHIRPSv2, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIAN-CCS-Adj, MSWEPv1.1, and PGFv3) over the complex topography and diverse climatic gradients of Chile. Different temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) are used in a point-to-pixel comparison between precipitation time series measured at 366 stations (from sea level to 4600 m a.s.l. in the Andean Plateau) and the corresponding grid cell of each SRE (rescaled to a 0.25° grid if necessary). The modified Kling–Gupta efficiency was used to identify possible sources of systematic errors in each SRE. In addition, five categorical indices (PC, POD, FAR, ETS, fBIAS) were used to assess the ability of each SRE to correctly identify different precipitation intensities.Results revealed that most SRE products performed better for the humid South (36.4–43.7° S) and Central Chile (32.18–36.4° S), in particular at low- and mid-elevation zones (0–1000 m a.s.l.) compared to the arid northern regions and the Far South. Seasonally, all products performed best during the wet seasons (autumn and winter; MAM–JJA) compared to summer (DJF) and spring (SON). In addition, all SREs were able to correctly identify the occurrence of no-rain events, but they presented a low skill in classifying precipitation intensities during rainy days. Overall, PGFv3 exhibited the best performance everywhere and for all timescales, which can be clearly attributed to its bias-correction procedure using 217 stations from Chile. Good results were also obtained by the research products CHIRPSv2, TMPA 3B42v7 and MSWEPv1.1, while CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, and the real-time PERSIANN-CCS-Adj were less skillful in representing observed rainfall. While PGFv3 (currently available up to 2010) might be used in Chile for historical analyses and calibration of hydrological models, the high spatial resolution, low latency and long data records of CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42v7 (in transition to IMERG) show promising potential to be used in meteorological studies and water resource assessments. We finally conclude that despite improvements of most SRE products, a site-specific assessment is still needed before any use in catchment-scale hydrological studies.

AB  - Coastal upwelling areas are highly productive marine systems in which the development of oxygen-depleted conditions and the availability of diverse electron donors (e.g., organic matter, NHz 4 ,H2S) favor the processes involved in nitrogen (N) loss. We characterize the temporal and vertical variability of anammox and denitrification over the continental shelf off central Chile (36.5°S), through 15N and 13C tracer experiments, including amendments with H2S and S2O2- 3 along with measurements of 15N2 and 15N2O production and oceanographic variables during a year (2009 to 2010). Restricted to the bottom waters, both anammox and denitrification contributed similarly (∼ 500 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) to N loss during spring, while a marked decrease in the activity of these processes occurred in summer (103 and 14 nmolN2 L-1 d-1 for anammox and denitrification, respectively). During fall, denitrification was the only contributor to the observed nitrogen deficit (894 nmol N2 L-1 d-1). Interestingly, a substantial increase in the rates of denitrification (∼ 1200 nmol N2 L-1 d-1) and dark 13C assimilation were observed after the addition of H2S, indicating an autotrophic contribution to denitrification, which could be fueled in situ by H2S emitted from sediments or produced in the water column. The observed patterns seem to be controlled (stimulated or inhibited) by the availability of oxygen, organic matter, andH2S. This study establishes the magnitude and co-occurrence of the different processes responsible for N removal in the coastal upwelling system of central Chile. This linkage of the nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur cycles is relevant to a global climate change scenario.

AB  - This paper is a pioneering analysis of past climates in southern South America combining multiproxy reconstructions and the state-of-the-art CMIP5/PMIP3 paleoclimatic models to investigate the time evolution of regional climatic conditions from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to the present. This analysis allows a comparison between the impact of the long term climate variations associated with insolation changes and the more recent effects of anthropogenic forcing on the region. The PMIP3 multimodel experiments suggest that changes in precipitation over almost all southern South America between MH and pre-industrial (PI) times due to insolation variations are significantly larger than those between PI and the present, which are due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Anthropogenic forcing has been particularly intense over western Patagonia inducing reduction of precipitation in summer, autumn and winter as a consequence of progressively weaker westerly winds over the region, which have moved further poleward, between ca. 35–55°S and have become stronger south of about 50°S. Orbital variations between the MH to the PI period increased insolation over southern South America during summer and autumn inducing warmer conditions in the PI, accentuated by the effect of anthropogenic forcing during the last century. On the other hand, changes in orbital parameters from the MH to the PI period reduced insolation during winter and spring inducing colder conditions, which have been reversed by the anthropogenic forcing.

AB  - In theory, building resilience is touted as one way to deal with climate change impacts; however, in practice, there is a need to examine how contexts influence the capacity of building resilience. A participatory process was carried out through workshops in regions affected by drought in Chile in 2014. The aim was to explore how resilience theory can be better applied and articulated into practice vis-á-vis participatory approaches that enrich the research process through the incorporation of co-produced. The results show that there are more differences in responses by type of actor than between regions, where issues of national interest, such as ‘education-information’ and ‘preparedness’, are highlighted over others. However, historically relevant local topics emerged as differentiators: decentralisation, and political will. This reinforces why special attention must be given to the different understandings in knowledge co-production processes. This study provides evidence and lessons on the importance of incorporating processes of the co-production of knowledge as a means to better articulate and transfer abstract concepts, such as resilience theory, into practice.

AB  - Past global climate changes had strong regional expression. To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi- decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971–2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years. D

AB  - The nosZ gene, which encodes for N2 O reduction to N2 , was used to study the structure of denitrifying communities in the oxygen minimum zone off Chilean and Peruvian coast throughout terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and cloning of nosZ genes. TRFLP analysis showed little diversity of nosZ genes at suboxic depths (Oxygen Minimum Zone´s core) compared with depths where O2 largely varied (upper limit of OMZ or ULOMZ). The nosZ-denitrifying communities showed differences in its structure between geographical locations and time sampling suggesting an association with the shift in the environmental conditions. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that the environmental parameters selected as predictor variables (N2 O, O2 , NH4 + and NO2 -) explained well the differences in nosZ-denitrifying community composition among sampling sites. The phylogenetic analysis showed little nosZ sequence diversity and grouped 81% of nosZ-clones near the cluster of sediments sequences from Pacific. Our sequences did not branch with any known denitrifying bacteria or seawater nosZ-sequences available, demonstrating the novelty of phylotypes founded in this area.

AB  - Socio-economic and environmental changes are well known causes of demographic collapse of agrarian cultures. The collapse of human societies is a complex phenomenon where historical and cultural dimensions play a key role, and they may interact with the environmental context. However, the importance of the interaction between socio-economic and climatic factors in explaining possible breakdowns in Native American societies has been poorly explored. The aim of this study is to test the role of socio-economic causes and rainfall variability in the collapse suffered by the Aymara people of the semiarid Andean region of Tarapacá during the period 1820–1970. Our motivation is to demonstrate that simple population dynamic models can be helpful in understanding the causes and relative importance of population changes in Andean agro-pastoral societies in responses to socio-environmental variability. Simple logistic models that combine the effects of external socio-economic causes and past rainfall variability (inferred from Gross Domestic Product [GDP] and tree-rings, respectively) were quite accurate in predicting the sustained population decline of the Aymara people. Our results suggest that the depopulation in the semiarid Tarapacá province was caused by the interaction among external socio-economic pressures given by the economic growth of the lowlands and demands for labor coupled with a persistent decline in rainfall. This study constitutes an example of how applied ecological knowledge, in particular the application of the logistic equation and theories pertaining to nonlinear population dynamics and exogenous perturbations, can be used to better understand major demographic changes in human societies.

AB  - Little is known about how old-growth and massive forests are responding to environmental change. We investigated tree-ring growth and carbon isotopes of the long-lived and high biomass Fitzroya cupressoides in two stands growing in contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range (∼300 years old) and Andean Cordilleras (>1500 years old) of southern Chile. The interannual variability in δ13C was assessed for the period 1800–2010, and changes in discrimination and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) were evaluated in relation to changes in climate and tree-ring growth during the last century. 13C discrimination has significantly decreased, and iWUE has increased since the 1900s in both sites. However, these trends in isotopic composition have been accompanied by different growth patterns: decreasing growth rates in the Coastal Range since the 1970s and increasing growth rates in the Andes since the 1900s. Trees growing in the Coastal Range have become more efficient in their use of water, probably due to reduced stomatal conductance caused by increases in CO2 and warming. Trees growing in the Andes have also become more water use efficient, but this has been likely due to increased photosynthetic rates. Fitzroya forests, including particularly old-growth stands, are responding to recent environmental changes, and their response has been site dependent. The growth of forests under a more Mediterranean climate influence and restrictive soil conditions in the Coastal Range has been more negatively affected by current warming and drying; while the growth of old stands in thewet Andes has been positively affected by changes in climate (decreasing cloudiness) and increasing CO2. Permanent monitoring of these endangered forests under ongoing environmental changes is needed in order to reassure the long-term preservation of this millennial-aged species.

TI  - Sensitivity of Southern Hemisphere circulation to LGM and 4 × CO2 climates
AU  - Rojas, M.
T2  - Geophysical Research Letters
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) versus high CO2 world boundary condition on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, in particular on the strength and latitudinal position of the near surface Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). PMIP2 and PMIP3 experiments, as well as the “abrupt 4 × CO2” simulations from CMIP5, were analyzed. Robust findings include poleward expansion of the Mean Meridional Circulation (MMC) and intensified and poleward-shifted SWW in the 4 × CO2 simulations (consistent with recent observations and 21st century climate change projections); and for the LGM, stronger and southward shifted northern hemisphere MMC, and weakened southern Hadley cell. However, six of the eight LGM simulations show a decrease in the SWW, the other two models simulate the opposite. A critical difference between the models is strong coupling between sea-ice extent, surface temperature gradients, SWW, and Ferrel cell in the two models with stronger and poleward-shifted SWW.

AB  - A growing interest in mapping the social value of ecosystem services (ES) is not yet methodologically aligned with what is actually being mapped. We critically examine aspects of the social value mapping process that might influence map outcomes and limit their practical use in decision making. We rely on an empirical case of participatory mapping, for a single ES (recreation opportunities), which involves diverse stakeholders such as planners, researchers, and community representatives. Value elicitation relied on an individual open-ended interview and a mapping exercise. Interpretation of the narratives and GIS calculations of proximity, centrality, and dispersion helped in exploring the factors driving participants’ answers. Narratives reveal diverse value types. Whereas planners highlighted utilitarian and aesthetic values, the answers from researchers revealed naturalistic values as well. In turn community representatives acknowledged symbolic values. When remitted to the map, these values were constrained to statements toward a much narrower set of features of the physical (e.g., volcanoes) and built landscape (e.g., roads). The results suggest that mapping, as an instrumental approach toward social valuation, may capture only a subset of relevant assigned values. This outcome is the interplay between participants’ characteristics, including their acquaintance with the territory and their ability with maps, and the mapping procedure itself, including the proxies used to represent the ES and the value typology chosen, the elicitation question, the cartographic features displayed on the base map, and the spatial scale.

AB  - Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chiloé Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ∼10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ∼7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales.

AB  - Dust deposition in the Southern Ocean constitutes a critical modulator of past global climate variability, but how it has varied temporally and geographically is underdetermined. Here, we present data sets of glacial-interglacial dust-supply cycles from the largest Southern Ocean sector, the polar South Pacific, indicating three times higher dust deposition during glacial periods than during interglacials for the past million years. Although the most likely dust source for the South Pacific is Australia and New Zealand, the glacial-interglacial pattern and timing of lithogenic sediment deposition is similar to dust records from Antarctica and the South Atlantic dominated by Patagonian sources. These similarities imply large-scale common climate forcings, such as latitudinal shifts of the southern westerlies and regionally enhanced glaciogenic dust mobilization in New Zealand and Patagonia.

AB  - Climate change is becoming an increasing threat to biodiversity. Consequently, methods for delineation, establishment and management of protected areas must consider the species' future distribution in response to future climate conditions. Biodiversity in high altitude semiarid regions may be particularly threatened by future climate change. In this study we assess the main environmental variables that best explain present day presence of the world's highest elevation woodlands in the South American Altiplano, and model how climate change may affect the future distribution of this unique ecosystem under different climate change scenarios. These woodlands are dominated by Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species that forms unique biological communities with important conservation value. Our results indicate that five environmental variables are responsible for 91% and 90.3% of the present and future P. tarapacana distribution models respectively, and suggest that at the end of the 21st century, there will be a significant reduction (56%) in the potential habitat for this species due to more arid conditions. Since it is predicted that P. tarapacana's potential distribution will be severely reduced in the future, we propose a new network of national protected areas across this species distribution range in order to insure the future conservation of this unique ecosystem. Based on an extensive literature review we identify research topics and recommendations for on-ground conservation and management of P. tarapacana woodlands.

AB  - On 4 and 8 January 2014, at the height of the austral summer, intense wildfires in forests and dry pastures occurred in the Melipilla sector, located about 70 km to the southwest of Santiago, the Chilean capital, affecting more than 6 million inhabitants. Low level winds transported the forest fire plume towards Santiago causing a striking decrease in visibility and a marked increase in the concentration of both primary (PM10 and CO) and secondary (Ozone) pollutants in the urban atmosphere. In particular, ozone maximum concentrations in the Santiago basin reached hourly averages well above 80 ppb, the national air quality standard. This ozone increase took place at the three sampling sites considered in the present study. These large values can be explained in terms of high NOx concentrations and NO2/NO ratios in biomass burning emissions.

AB  - Making accurate estimations of daily and annual Rs fluxes is key for understanding the carbon cycle process and projecting effects of climate change. In this study we used high-frequency sampling (24 measurements per day) of Rs in a temperate rainforest during 1 year, with the objective of answering the questions of when and how often measurements should be made to obtain accurate estimations of daily and annual Rs. We randomly selected data to simulate samplings of 1, 2, 4 or 6 measurements per day (distributed either during the whole day or only during daytime), combined with 4, 6, 12, 26 or 52 measurements per year. Based on the comparison of partial-data series with the full-data series, we estimated the performance of different partial sampling strategies based on bias, precision and accuracy. In the case of annual Rs estimation, we compared the performance of interpolation vs. using non-linear modelling based on soil temperature. The results show that, under our study conditions, sampling twice a day was enough to accurately estimate daily Rs (RMSE  <  10 % of average daily flux), even if both measurements were done during daytime. The highest reduction in RMSE for the estimation of annual Rs was achieved when increasing from four to six measurements per year, but reductions were still relevant when further increasing the frequency of sampling. We found that increasing the number of field campaigns was more effective than increasing the number of measurements per day, provided a minimum of two measurements per day was used. Including night-time measurements significantly reduced the bias and was relevant in reducing the number of field campaigns when a lower level of acceptable error (RMSE  <  5 %) was established. Using non-linear modelling instead of linear interpolation did improve the estimation of annual Rs, but not as expected. In conclusion, given that most of the studies of Rs use manual sampling techniques and apply only one measurement per day, we suggest performing an intensive sampling at the beginning of the study to determine minimum daily and annual frequencies of sampling.

AB  - The responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other climate variables to an emission pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere are often used to compute the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), to characterize the response timescales of Earth System models, and to build reduced-form models. In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 ± 9% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 ± 12% and the land the remainder (16 ± 14%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 ± 0.12 °C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.

AB  - We have presented a descriptive analysis showing a suite of different global products that combine information from models and satellites to provide the global distribution of surface total solar radiation as well as the distribution of the main substances that explain the atmospheric extinction of solar radiation reaching the surface. Latitude, elevation, cloud fraction, water vapor, and aerosols have a first-order influence on the distribution of surface solar radiation over the planet, and no single factor explains the combined distribution. The most likely location of the total solar radiation over the surface of the planet is on the pre-Andean Domeyko Cordillera, a mountain range with elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 m. The regional climate of the Atacama is such that extremely low values of water vapor, cloud cover, ozone, and aerosols concur in this region. The atmospheric transparency in the visible and infrared provided by these conditions, together with a relatively high elevation and low latitude, conspire to produce a region where mean total radiation values exceed 300 W m-2. According to a semiempirical model for surface solar radiation that takes into account extinction by gases, clouds, aerosols, and the effect of topography, the maximum is about 310 ± 15 W m-2, although for individual years, especially those with dry summertime Altiplano conditions, the solar maximum should be located in the Altiplano region near to the Chajnantor Plateau. The delicate combination of elements that concurs in the Atacama region still justifies the increase in observational capabilities of solar radiation and atmospheric composition as it was first devised and executed by the pioneers of solar research in Mount Montezuma in the early twentieth century.

T2  - Environmental Pollution
AB  - Temuco is a mid-size city representative of severe wood smoke pollution in southern Chile; i.e., ambient 24-h PM2.5 concentrations have exceeded 150 μg/m3 in the winter season and the top concentration reached 372 μg/m3 in 2010. Annual mean concentrations have decreased but are still above 30 μg/m3. For the very first time, a molecular marker source apportionment of ambient organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 was conducted in Temuco. Primary resolved sources for PM2.5 were wood smoke (37.5%), coal combustion (4.4%), diesel vehicles (3.3%), dust (2.2%) and vegetative detritus (0.7%). Secondary inorganic PM2.5 (sulfates, nitrates and ammonium) contributed 4.8% and unresolved organic aerosols (generated from volatile emissions from incomplete wood combustion), including secondary organic aerosols, contributed 47.1%. Adding the contributions of unresolved organic aerosols to those from primary wood smoke implies that wood burning is responsible for 84.6% of the ambient PM2.5 in Temuco. This predominance of wood smoke is ultimately due to widespread poverty and a lack of efficient household heating methods. The government has been implementing emission abatement policies but achieving compliance with ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 in southern Chile remains a challenge.

AB  - Ecological disturbances triggered by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are of fundamental importance in structuring the temperate forests of southwestern South America and New Zealand. We review studies of the ecological effects of these tectonic phenomena and how they have been central to progress in the modern development of forest ecology in both regions. Studies of tectonic influences on the dynamics of southern temperate rainforests of Chile and New Zealand published in the 1970s and early 1980s contributed prominently to the shift away from the equilibrium paradigms dominant globally in the 1960s and towards modern non- equilibrium frameworks of forest dynamics. Empirical studies of tectonic ecology in these temperate forests in combination with critical evaluations of earlier successional theory have significantly advanced understanding of the roles of coarse scale disturbance in the dynamics of forests in southwestern South America and New Zealand. Recognition that cohort forest For Peer Review Only structures triggered by exogenous disturbances such as wind storms and tectonic events are the norm rather than all-aged structures has been of fundamental importance to understanding the dynamics of these forests. The non-equilibrium patch dynamics framework for interpreting forest structure and dynamics bolstered by tectonic ecology studies in southern South America and New Zealand was of key importance in refining older views of these forests as being out of equilibrium with contemporary climate, revising understanding of the effects of introduced browsing animals on forest structure, and guiding the development of appropriate forest management practices.

T2  - Progress in Oceanography
AB  - Coastal upwelling ecosystems are areas of high productivity and strong outgassing, where most gases, such as N2O and CH4, are produced in subsurface waters by anaerobic metabolisms. We describe seasonal CH4 variation as well as potential mechanisms producing CH4 in surface waters of the central Chile upwelling ecosystem (36°S). Surface waters were always supersaturated in CH4 (from 125% up to 550%), showing a clear seasonal signal triggered by wind driven upwelling processes (austral spring-summer period), that matched with the periods of high chlorophyll-a and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) levels. Methane cycling experiments, with/without the addition of dimethylsulfide (including 13C-DMS) and acetylene (a nonspecific inhibitor of CH4 oxidation) along with monthly measurements of CH4, DMSP and other oceanographic variables revealed that DMS can be a CH4 precursor. Net CH4 cycling rates (control) fluctuated between -0.64 and 1.44nmolL-1d-1. After the addition of acetylene, CH4 cycling rates almost duplicated relative to the control, suggesting a strong methanotrophic activity. With a spike of DMS, the net CH4 cycling rate significantly increased relative to the acetylene and control treatment. Additionally, the δ13C values of CH4 at the end of the incubations (after addition of 13C enriched-DMS) were changed, reaching -32‰ PDB compared to natural values between -44‰ and -46‰ PDB. These findings indicate that, in spite of the strong CH4 consumption by methanotrophs, this upwelling area is an important source of CH4 to the atmosphere. The effluxes are derived partially from in situ surface production and seem to be related to DMSP/DMS metabolism. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Unicellular cyanobacteria are ubiquitous photoautotrophic microbes that contribute substantially to global primary production. Picocyanobacteria such as  Synechococcus  and  Prochlorococcus  depend on chlorophyll a-binding protein complexes to capture light energy. In addition,  Synechococcus  has accessory pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and  Prochlorococcus  contains chlorophyll  b . Across a surface water transect spanning the sparsely studied tropical Indian Ocean, we examined  Synechococcus  and  Prochlorococcus  occurrence, taxonomy and habitat preference in an evolutionary context. Shotgun sequencing of size fractionated microbial communities from 0.1 μm to 20 μm and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicated that cyanobacteria account for up to 15% of annotated reads, with the genera  Prochlorococcus  and  Synechococcus  comprising 90% of the cyanobacterial reads, even in the largest size fraction (3.0–20 mm). Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial light-harvesting genes (chl-binding  pcb/isi A, allophycocyanin ( apc AB), phycocyanin ( cpc AB) and phycoerythin ( cpe AB)) mostly identified picocyanobacteria clades comprised of overlapping sequences obtained from Indian Ocean, Atlantic and/or Pacific Oceans samples. Habitat reconstructions coupled with phylogenetic analysis of the Indian Ocean samples suggested that large  Synechococcus -like ancestors in coastal waters expanded their ecological niche towards open oligotrophic waters in the Indian Ocean through lineage diversification and associated streamlining of genomes ( e . g . loss of phycobilisomes and acquisition of Chl  b ); resulting in contemporary small celled  Prochlorococcus . Comparative metagenomic analysis with picocyanobacteria populations in other oceans suggests that this evolutionary scenario may be globally important.

T2  - Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy
AB  - There is growing recognition that routine climate change framing is insufficient for addressing the challenges presented by this change, and that different framings of climate change shape stakeholders' practices and guide policy options. This research investigated how stakeholders conceptualise climate change in terms of its seriousness and related uncertainty, and a resilience approach as a possible policy option to confront this uncertainty. An application of the conceptual framework provided by Handmer and Dovers' typology of emergencies is novel to the climate change field. Results show that there is a tendency to frame climate change as complex (with uncertainty representing part of that complexity) and to confront this complexity with less complex policies and solutions. No pattern of a conceptual link between uncertainty and resilience was observed. The results presented in this study offer empirical evidence to inform theory and provide helpful insights to inform policy design and practice.

T2  - Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology
AB  - In this work, we present combined statistical indexes for evaluating air quality monitoring networks based on concepts derived from the information theory and Kullback–Liebler divergence. More precisely, we introduce: (1) the standard measure of complementary mutual information or ‘specificity’ index; (2) a new measure of information gain or ‘representativity’ index; (3) the information gaps associated with the evolution of a network and (4) the normalised information distance used in clustering analysis. All these information concepts are illustrated by applying them to 14 yr of data collected by the air quality monitoring network in Santiago de Chile (33.5 S, 70.5 W, 500 m a.s.l.). We find that downtown stations, located in a relatively flat area of the Santiago basin, generally show high ‘representativity’ and low ‘specificity’, whereas the contrary is found for a station located in a canyon to the east of the basin, consistently with known emission and circulation patterns of Santiago. We also show interesting applications of information gain to the analysis of the evolution of a network, where the choice of background information is also discussed, and of mutual information distance to the classifications of stations. Our analyses show that information as those presented here should of course be used in a complementary way when addressing the analysis of an air quality network for planning and evaluation purposes.

AB  - This paper explores the use of active and passive microwave satellite soil moisture products for improving streamflow prediction within four large (>5000km2) semiarid catchments in Australia. We use the probability distributed model (PDM) under a data-scarce scenario and aim at correcting two key controlling factors in the streamflow generation: the rainfall forcing data and the catchment wetness condition. The soil moisture analysis rainfall tool (SMART) is used to correct a near real-time satellite rainfall product (forcing correction scheme) and an ensemble Kalman filter is used to correct the PDM soil moisture state (state correction scheme). These two schemes are combined in a dual correction scheme and we assess the relative improvements of each. Our results demonstrate that the quality of the satellite rainfall product is improved by SMART during moderate-to-high daily rainfall events, which in turn leads to improved streamflow prediction during high flows. When employed individually, the soil moisture state correction scheme generally outperforms the rainfall correction scheme, especially for low flows. Overall, the combined dual correction scheme further improves the streamflow predictions (reduction in root mean square error and false alarm ratio, and increase in correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency). Our results provide new evidence of the value of satellite soil moisture observations within data-scarce regions. We also identify a number of challenges and limitations within the schemes.

AB  - Temperate forest represents the smallest area among the main world's forest biomes, but is one of those most threatened by forest loss. Chile contains most of the temperate forest in South America and more than half of the temperate forest in the southern hemisphere. Chilean temperate forest is considered to be one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. In this study we assessed the rate of land use and land cover (LULC) change over time, identified the main LULCs replacing native forest, and described how changes have evolved in contrasting physiographical conditions and through different historical phases of the landscape over the last 40 years. To achieve this, we analysed LULC change with particular focus on forest cover in three areas representing different physiographical conditions and histories of human occupation in the Araucanía Region of Chile, namely the Central Valley, the Coastal range, and the Andean range. We found substantial differences in temporal and intra-regional patterns of forest loss and LULC change. In the Central Valley, forest loss started long ago, and the area occupied by native forest nowadays is less than 5% of the landscape. In the Coastal range, rapid land cover change has taken place since 1973, with an increasing rate of forest loss over time. We detected a similar but less intense pattern in the forests of the Andean range. Overall, the general pattern points to a process of landscape homogenization in all three physiographical areas. Exotic tree plantations have spread over large geographical areas, becoming the dominant land cover. Land cover change in the Araucanía Region reflects a model of change in which areas with better environmental conditions and accessibility are occupied first for productive activities. As the availability of suitable areas for the expansion of productive activities diminishes, these activities start to move into physiographical areas which were previously “protected” by adverse environmental conditions or poor accessibility. This model of production growth could lead to the complete deforestation of areas outside national protected areas, and other areas which still remain inaccessible due to technological restrictions on exploitation.

T2  - Journal of Coastal Research
AB  - Regional sea-level change for Chile is considered until the end of the 21st century for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The main components that contribute to sea-level change are analyzed and summed to achieve a total estimate of sea-level change along the coast of Chile and in the Southeast Pacific. Included are the steric/dynamic component, the contribution from land ice loss and the sea- level change due to the glacial isostatic adjustment. Regional fingerprints and global means are combined to estimate sea-level change in this area. For the steric/dynamic component two different estimates are considered. The results are compared to those found in the IPCC AR5 report. The total mean sea-level rise along the coast lies between 34 cm and 52 cm for the RCP4.5 scenario and between 46 cm and 74 cm for the RCP8.5 scenario, depending on the location and the steric/dynamic component estimate considered. This component is the main contribution in each scenario. All estimates show a modest, relatively constant decrease in sea-level rise along the coast from north to south.

AB  - The South Pacific region represents the world's largest oceanic water mass and plays a significant role in the earth's climate systems. This region also contains the largest group of island nations, most of whom are dependent on marine resources for their livelihoods. Several of the largest coastal and oceanic gisheries also occur in this region (FAO, 2014). In addition, for the countries associated with the southern Pacific Ocean region, the sea provides significant social, cultural and economic benefits, with many countries being heavily reliant on both coastal and oceanic marine resources (Bell et al., 2013). Increasing coastal populations and climate change are expected to augment human demands on already fully exploited or over-exploited marine resources, threatening both food security and sustainable livelihoods (Bell et al. 2011). Therefore, its imperative that the science that describes and predicts linked biophysical and human systems is understood and developed to meet these needs. Climate change will have many impacts on marine ecosystems, with implications for end users including individuals, local communities, industries and governments. Improved scientific support for policy and management decision-making in the face of these potential impacts is essential.

T2  - Climate of the Past
AB  - In this paper we assess South American monsoon system (SAMS) variability in the last millennium as depicted by global coupled climate model simulations. High-resolution proxy records for the South American monsoon over this period show a coherent regional picture of a weak monsoon during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and a stronger monsoon during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Due to the small external forcing during the past 1000 years, model simulations do not show very strong temperature anomalies over these two specific periods, which in turn do not translate into clear precipitation anomalies, in contrast with the rainfall reconstructions in South America. Therefore, we used an ad hoc definition of these two periods for each model simulation in order to account for model-specific signals. Thereby, several coherent large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies are identified. The models feature a stronger monsoon during the LIA associated with (i) an enhancement of the rising motion in the SAMS domain in austral summer; (ii) a stronger monsoon-related upper-tropospheric anticyclone; (iii) activation of the South American dipole, which results in a poleward shift of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone; and (iv) a weaker upper-level subtropical jet over South America. The diagnosed changes provide important insights into the mechanisms of these climate anomalies over South America during the past millennium.

AB  - Fjords and estuaries exchange large amounts of solutes, gases, and particulates between fluvial and marine systems. These exchanges and their relative distributions of compounds/particles are partially controlled by stratification and water circulation. The spatial and vertical distributions of N2O, an important greenhouse gas, along with other oceanographic variables, are analyzed from the Reloncaví estuary (RE) (~41° 30′ S) to the gulf of Corcovado in the interior sea of Chiloé (43° 45′ S) during the austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the estuary regulated salinity and stratification of the water column, clearly demarking the surface (<5 m depth) and subsurface layer (>5 m depth) and also separating estuarine and marine influenced areas. N2O levels varied between 8.3 and 21 nM (corresponding to 80 and 170 % saturation, respectively), being significantly lower (11.8 ± 1.70) at the surface than in subsurface waters in the Reloncaví estuary (14.5 ± 1.73). Low salinity and NO3 −, NO2 −, and PO4 3− levels, as well as high Si(OH)4 values were associated with low surface N2O levels. Remarkably, an accumulation of N2O was observed in the subsurface waters of the Reloncaví sound, associated with a relatively high consumption of O2. The sound is exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts from aquaculture and urban discharge, occurring simultaneously with an internal recirculation, which leads to potential signals of early eutrophication. In contrast, within the interior sea of Chiloé (ISC), most of water column was quasi homohaline and occupied by modified subantarctic water (MSAAW), which was relatively rich in N2O (12.6 ± 2.36 nM) and NO3 − (18.3 ± 1.63 μM). The relationship between salinity, nutrients, and N2O revealed that water from the open ocean, entering into ISC (the Gulf of Corcovado) through the Guafo mouth, was the main source of N2O (up to 21 nM), as it gradually mixed with estuarine water. In addition, significant relationships between N2O excess vs. AOU and N2O excess vs. NO3 − suggest that part of N2O is also produced by nitrification. Our results show that the estuarine and marine waters can act as light source or sink of N2O to the atmosphere (air–sea N2O fluxes ranged from −1.57 to 5.75 μmol m−2 day−1), respectively; influxes seem to be associated to brackish water depleted in N2O that also caused a strong stratification, creating a barrier to gas exchange.

AB  - In 2013, the international Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (iCACGP) and the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project Americas Working Group (iCACGP/IGAC AWG) was formed to build a cohesive network and foster the next generation of atmospheric scientists with the goal of contributing to a scientific community focused on building collective knowledge for the Americas. The Latin America–Caribbean (LAC) region shares common history, culture, and socioeconomic issues but, at the same time, it is highly diverse in its physical and human geography. The LAC region is unique because approximately 80% of its population lives in urban areas, resulting in high-density hotspots of urbanization and vast unpopulated rural areas. In recent years, most countries of the region have experienced rapid growth in population and industrialization as their economies emerge. The rapid urbanization, the associated increases in mobile and industrial sources, and the growth of the agricultural activities related to biomass burning have degraded air quality in certain areas of the LAC region. Air pollution has negative implications for human health, ecosystems, and climate. In addition, air pollution and the warming caused by greenhouse gases could impact the melting of Andean glaciers, an important source of freshwater. To better understand the links between air pollution and climate, it is necessary to increase the number of atmospheric scientists and improve our observational, analytical, and modeling capacities. This requires sustained and prioritized funding as well as stronger collaboration within the LAC region.

AB  - Current debate on the implementation of resilience in addressing climatic impacts calls for more pragmatic means of reducing losses. In this study we aimed to generate context-specific knowledge about resilience factors for addressing the impacts of drought, with the expectation that bringing forth experiential knowledge on how impacts were addressed in the past would shed light on what constitutes key resilience factors for practitioners working in urban contexts. The study was carried in three of the largest cities in Chile: Santiago, Concepción, and Valdivia. The analytical framework consists of urban and regional resilience incorporating transdisciplinary approaches applying the Resilience-Wheel tool, combined with participatory methods for the co-production of knowledge and qualitative content analysis of documents and workshops. Results show that key determinants of building resilience to drought were: improving education and access to information, enhancing preparedness, promoting technology transfer, reinforcing organizational linkages and collaboration, decentralizing governance, and encouraging citizen participation. The Resilience-Wheel was useful for navigating the conceptual complexity and diversity of perspectives inherent among social actors. The transdisciplinary approach allowed us to co-produce key knowledge that can be applied to build resilience in future, through a bottom-up approach that bridges the science–policy interface.

AB  - We report on an episode of extremely low precipitable water vapour (PWV) of approximately 0.1mm with a duration of more than 12 h at European Southern Observatory's Paranal observatory [2635m above sea level (asl)]. Such conditions are more commonly expected at sites at much higher altitude such as ALMA on the Chajnantor plateau (5000m asl) or otherwise particularly dry sites such as locations in Antarctica. We provide a full account ofthe measurements of PWV and other relevant atmospheric parameters. An explanation of the observed conditions is given in terms of the prevailing meteorological pattern. Based on statistical evidence from measurements by VLT spectrographs (UVES and CRIRES) covering more than a decade, we find that PWV <0.2mm can be expected on less than 1 per cent of the nights, while <0.5mm is encountered on 6-7 nights per year (≈2 per cent). The scientificpotential of using this small but significant fraction of observing time is illustrated in the context of service modeSociety. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.

AB  - This study presents newly obtained coral ages of the cold-water corals Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata collected in the Alboran Sea and the Strait of Sicily (Urania Bank). These data were combined with all available Mediterranean Lophelia and Madrepora ages compiled from literature to conduct a basin-wide assessment of the spatial and temporal occurrence of these prominent framework-forming scleractinian species in the Mediterranean realm and to unravel the palaeo-environmental conditions that controlled their proliferation or decline. For the first time special focus was placed on a closer examination of potential differences occurring between the eastern and western Mediterranean sub-basins. Our results clearly demonstrate that cold-water corals occurred sparsely in the entire Mediterranean during the last glacial before becoming abundant during the Bølling-Allerød warm interval, pointing to a basin-wide, almost concurrent onset in (re-)colonisation after ∼13.5. ka. This time coincides with a peak in meltwater discharge originating from the northern Mediterranean borderlands which caused a major reorganisation of the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. During the Younger Dryas and Holocene, some striking differences in coral proliferation were identified between the sub-basins such as periods of highly prolific coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Younger Dryas and in the western basin during the Early Holocene, whereas a temporary pronounced coral decline during the Younger Dryas was exclusively affecting coral sites in the Alboran Sea. Comparison with environmental and oceanographic data revealed that the proliferation of the Mediterranean corals is linked with enhanced productivity conditions. Moreover, corals thrived in intermediate depths and showed a close relationship with intermediate water mass circulation in the Mediterranean sub-basins. For instance, reduced Levantine Intermediate Water formation hampered coral growth in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during sapropel S1 event as reduced Winter Intermediate Water formation did in the westernmost part of the Mediterranean (Alboran Sea) during the Mid-Holocene. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates the importance to consider region-specific environmental changes as well as species-specific environmental preferences in interpreting coral chronologies. Moreover, it highlights that the occurrence or decline of cold-water corals is not controlled by one key parameter but rather by a complex interplay of various environmental variables.

AB  - This perspective paper reviews progress made in the last decades to enhance the communication and use of climate information relevant to the political and economic decision process. It focuses, specifically, on the creation and development of climate services, and highlights a number of difficulties that have limited the success of these services. Among them are the insufficient awareness by societal actors of their vulnerability to climate change, the lack of relevant products and services offered by the scientific community, the inappropriate format in which the information is provided, and the inadequate business model adopted by climate services. The authors suggest that, to be effective, centers should host within the same center a diversity of staff including experts in climate science, specialists in impact, adaptation and vulnerability, representatives of the corporate world, agents of the public service as well as social managers and communication specialists. The role and importance of environmental engineering is emphasized.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - The concept of ecosystem services from landscapes is rapidly gaining momentum as a language to communicate values and benefits to scientists and lay alike. Landscape ecology has an enormous contribution to make to this field, and one could argue, uniquely so. Tools developed or adapted for landscape ecology are being increasingly used to assist with the quantification, modelling, mapping, and valuing of ecosystem services. Several of these tools and methods encased therein are described among the eleven papers presented in this special issue, and their application has the potential to facilitate the management and promotion of services within ecosystems. Papers are associated with each of the four key categories of services that ecosystems provide to humans: supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural. The papers represent work conducted in eleven different countries, especially from South America. Each carries a unique approach to address a particular question pertaining to a particular set of ecosystem services. These studies are designed to inform and improve the economic, environmental and social values of the ecosystem services. This knowledge should help to develop new management alternatives for sustaining and planning ecosystems and the services they provide at different scales in space and time. We believe that these papers will create interest and inform management of some potential methods to evaluate ecosystem services at the landscape level with an integrative approach, offering new tools for management and conservation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - The Valdivian rainforest ecoregion in Chile (35°-48°S) has a high conservation priority worldwide. These forests are also keys for social welfare as a result of their supply of timber as well as ecosystem services. Forests in the ecoregion have been extensively converted to fast growing Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. plantations for timber production promoted by public policies and timber companies. This study describes the results of detailed measurements of hydrology and stream water chemistry in eight small watersheds in south central Chile, subjected to replacement of native temperate rainforest by exotic Eucalyptus plantations. In this system, watersheds have streamside buffers of native forest (SNFW) with varying widths. Results indicate that retention of SNFW counteracts hydrologic effects of Eucalyptus plantations, which are widely known to reduce water yields. A 1.4% rate of increase of the run-off coefficient for each metre of increase of SNFW was observed. In addition, a decrease in the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), nitrate-N, and different sized fractions of particulate organic matter were found in streams draining these plantations as a function of increasing SNFW. Streamside buffer widths of 17-22m for total nitrogen and DIN concentrations and ≥36m for sediments were required to provide comparable values to reference watersheds (100% native forest). The findings from this study suggest that SNFW may significantly reduce adverse effects from exotic species forestry plantations on water provision in an area of south central Chile where exotic forest plantations are rapidly expanding. © 2015 John Wiley

T2  - Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans
AB  - The effect of the high frequency (synoptic) variability of wind and heat fluxes upon the surface ocean off south-central Chile (west coast of South America) is investigated using a regional ocean model. We focus our analysis in austral summer, when the regional wind experiences significant day-to-day variability superimposed on a mean, upwelling favorable flow. To evaluate the nature and magnitude of these effects, we performed three identical simulations except for the surface forcing: the climatological run, with long-term monthly mean wind-stresses and heat fluxes; the wind-synoptic run, with daily wind stresses and climatological heat fluxes; and the full-synoptic run, with daily wind-stresses and daily fluxes. The mean currents and surface geostrophic EKE fields show no major differences between simulations, and agree well with those observed in this ocean area. Nevertheless, substantially more ageostrophic EKE is found in the simulations which include synoptic variability of wind-stresses, impacting the total surface EKE and diffusivities, particularly south of Punta Lavapie (37° S), where the lack of major currents implies low levels of geostrophic EKE. Summer mean SSTs are similar in all simulations and agree with observations, but SST variability along the coast is larger in the runs including wind-stress synoptic variability, suggesting a rather linear response of the ocean to cycles of southerly wind strengthening and relaxation. We found that coastal SST variability does not change significantly in the first tenths of kilometers from the shore when including daily heat fluxes, highlighting the prominent role of wind-driven upwelling cycles. In contrast, in the offshore region situated beyond the 50 km coastal strip, it is necessary to include synoptic variability in the heat fluxes to account for a realistic SST variability.

AU  - Cornejo, Marcela

T2  - Progress in Oceanography
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a trace gas affecting atmospheric radiative forcing through its greenhouse effect in the troposphere and destroying the ozone in the stratosphere. The oceans account for one-third of the global atmospheric N2O emissions, in which they are primarily cycled by nitrification and denitrification, with high N2O production in the subsurface waters. The surface waters are generally reported to be in equilibrium or slightly supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. However, surface N2O sub-saturations have been observed in several regions of the world's oceans, such as off south-central Chile, which is bathed by the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), where N2O subsaturations as low as 35% have been registered during the austral spring and summer. An analysis of the mechanisms driving such surface N2O subsaturations (physical or biological) showed that physical mechanisms were not responsible for the high surface N2O deficit. In contrast, in situ potential experiments in surface waters with 15N2O addition showed an active biological N2O fixation (between 0.43 and 87.34nmol/L/d), with the highest N2O fixation rates associated with the SAAW (25.25-25.75kg/m3).Additionally, incubation experiments with 15N2O in surface water samples from one oceanic station showed high 15N-POM enrichment (0.44‰) and an inhibition of 15N-POM enrichment when an additional nitrogen source was added (NO2 - and NH4 +). These results suggest the existence of a mechanism able to use several nitrogen sources, including N2O. Molecular analyses (16S rRNA gene) from these experiments showed the presence of three major groups of bacteria: Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria and Cyanobacteria, with Synechococcus sp. being the dominant group in the culture. However, the analysis of the nifH gene showed a taxonomic affiliation to the order Stigonematales associated with Mastigocladus sp. and Fischerella sp. and the order Oscillatoriales associated with Trichodesmium sp.Finally, the oceanic region exhibiting surface N2O subsaturations acts as a sink for atmospheric N2O, consuming ∼11.4 Gg of N2O in a six-month period. The N2O levels in the sink are 75% higher than those of the reported N2O source from the coastal band. The balance between the oceanic region and the coastal band results in a sink region of 4.94 Gg of N2O during this period.

AB  - In the last decades, forest fires have been a concern in different regions of the world, especially by increased occurrences product of human activities and climate changes. In this study the spatio-temporal trends in the occurrence and area affected by fire in the Maule region during the period 1986-2012 were examined. We use the Corporación Nacional Forestal fire database, whose records were spatially represented by a grid of 2x2 km. The occurrence was stable during the analyzed period with an average of 378 events per year. The burned area presented three periods above average with 5.273 hectares per year. Most of the fires affected surfaces of less than 5 hectares, while a very small number of events explain most of the area annually burned in the region. According to the startup fuel, we found an increasing number of events initiated in forest plantations in contrast to the decreasing number of fires originated in the native forests. Causes of fires associated with transit and transportation were the most important. The number of events accidentally caused by burning waste significantly increased in the period studied. Most of the fires occurred in the coastal area and the central valley, strongly associated with the road network and the most populated cities. This work represents an important contribution to the characterization of forest fires in the region of Maule, being the first to represent the fire statistics in Chile in a spatially explicit way.

AB  - Understanding how human societies interacted with environmental changes is a major goal of archaeology and other socio-natural sciences. In this paper, we assess the human-environment interactions in the Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT) basin of the Atacama Desert over the last 13,000 years. By relying on a socio-environmental model that integrates ecosystem services with adaptive strategies, we review past climate changes, shifting environmental conditions, and the continuities and discontinuities in the nature and intensity of the human occupation of the PDT. As a result we highlight the importance of certain key resources such as water, an essential factor in the long-term trajectory of eco-historical change. Without water the outcome of human societies becomes hazardous.

AB  - Post-fire recruitment by seeds is regarded as an adaptive response in fire-prone ecosystems. Nevertheless, little is known about which heritable seed traits are functional to the main signals of fire (heat and smoke), thus having the potential to evolve. Here, we explored whether three seed traits (pubescence, dormancy and shape) and fire regime modulate seed response to fire cues(heat and smoke). As a model study system, we used  Helenium aromaticum  (Asteraceae), a native annual forb from the Chilean matorral, where fires are anthropogenic. We related seed trait values with fitness responses (germination and survival) after exposure to heat-shock and smoke experimental treatments on seeds from 10  H .  aromaticum  wild populations. We performed a phenotypic selection experiment to examine the relationship of seed traits with post-treatment fitness within a population (adaptive hypothesis). We then explored whether fire frequency in natural habitats was associated with trait expression across populations, and with germination and survival responses to experimental fire-cues. We found that populations subjected to higher fire frequency had, in average, more rounded and pubescent seeds than populations from rarely burned areas. Populations with more rounded and pubescent seeds were more resistant to 80°C heat-shock and smoke treatments.There was correlated selection on seed traits: pubescent-rounded or glabrouscent-elongated seeds had the highest probability of germinating after heat-shock treatments. Seed pubescence and shape in  H .  aromaticum  are heritable traits that modulate adaptive responses to fire. Our results provide new insights into the process of plant adaptation to fire and highlight the relevance of human-made fires as a strong evolutionary agent in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Paleontological and archaeological sites have frequently been found in open locations of the Intermediate Depression of south-central Chile. This paper presents the results of two field sampling seasons carried out at the Pilauco Site (ca. 39°S) and compares them with those of three well known sites in Chile: Quereo, Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, ca. 32°, 34° and 41°S, respectively. Stratigraphic data collected at Pilauco and the resulting radiocarbon age model suggest that before 12,540 ± 90 BP the old Damas River eroded an older volcaniclastic hill, which was followed by a bog formation in an ox-bow lake. The site was developing up to 11,004 ± 186 BP, the date of the youngest vertebrate fossil. Two younger peat beds seal the site. As in Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, Gomphotheres are the most represented megafauna. Fossils of Equidae, Camelidae, Cervidae, Mephitidae, Muridae, Myocastoridae and Xenarthra are also found in Pilauco. As a whole, 718 bones, 30 teeth and 11 coprolites represent the extinct and extant vertebrates. Preliminary taphonomic results suggest action of various agents in the bones, i.e. trampling, root etching, abrasion, and carnivore gnawing. The spatial analysis suggests the transfer of smaller anatomical units (e.g. bones of camelids and horses) and the rearrangement of some pieces comparatively large (e.g. gomphothere bones). Similar to the present day north Patagonian landscape, the area where Pilauco site is located had a variety of animal resources, plants and stones in an ecotone between hills, floodplains and wetlands. A total of 101 lithics were recorded: basalt and quartzite were collected from nearby fluvial deposits and dacitic obsidian from the local volcaniclastic deposits. Debitage is the most represented lithic item (75%); cores and marginal edge-trimmed artifacts represented 12 and 13%, respectively. Artifacts and flakes are spatially and temporality associated in the same PB-7 bed with high bone concentrations in some specific areas, between 361 and 424 cm of local altitude. This industry is characterized by a recurrent lithic expedite technology with production of flakes and chips which mastered marginal retouches over the bifacial trimming. This seems to be connected to strategic conditions of high resource diversity, especially of human groups with a high or medium mobility across land. Pilauco represents a site contemporaneous to Monte Verde related as well to the first human occupation in the southern cone of South America, but with higher mammal diversity.

AB  - Surface coastal observations from two automatic weather stations at Paposo (~25° S) and radiosonde observations at Paposo and Iquique (~20° S) were carried out during VOCALS-REx (VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment). Within the coastal marine boundary layer (MBL), sea–land breezes are superimposed on the prevailing southerlies, resulting in light northeasterly winds from midnight to early morning and strong southwesterlies in the afternoon. The prevailing northerlies above the MBL and below the top of the Andes are modulated by the onshore-offshore (zonal) flow forced by the diurnal cycle of surface heating/cooling along the western slope of the Andes. The daytime phase of this diurnal cycle is consistent with an enhanced afternoon coastal subsidence manifested in afternoon warming near the top of the subsidence inversion (~1.8 K at 800 hPa), lowering (~130 m) of its base (top of the MBL), and clearing of coastal Sc (stratocumulus) clouds. Results from a numerical simulation of the atmospheric circulation in a mean zonal cross section over the study area capture the afternoon zonal wind divergence and resulting subsidence of about 2 cm s−1 along a narrow (~10 km) coastal strip maximizing at around 800 hPa. Day-to-day variability in the MBL depth during VOCALS-REx shows sub-synoptic oscillations, aside from two major disruptions in connection with a deep trough and a cutoff low, as described elsewhere. These oscillations are phase-locked to those in sea-level pressure and afternoon alongshore southerlies, as found in connection with coastal lows farther south. 

From 24-h forward trajectories issued from significant points at the coast and inland at the extremes of the diurnal cycle, it can be concluded that the strong mean daytime Andean pumping prevents any possibility of continental sulfur sources from reaching the free troposphere above the Sc cloud deck in at least a one-day timescale, under mean conditions. Conversely, coastal sources could contribute with sulfur aerosols preferentially in the morning, provided that the weak daytime inland flow becomes partially blocked by the coastal terrain.

AB  - The iconic conifer Araucaria araucana (Araucaria), called Pehuén by native people, is an endemic species of the Andes of northern Patagonia in Chile and Argentina. Its range encompasses only three degrees of latitude (37 ◦ 20 – 40 ◦ 20 S) with a small outlying presence in the coastal mountains of Chile (Veblen et al. 1995). The species is classified as endangered (Premoli et al. 2013) because of extensive logging and human-set fires. 
Araucaria araucana has a long history of ethnobiological importance. For centuries the Pehuén fruits have been a vital sustainable food source for the Pehuenche people (Mapuche) and today the growing industry of ecotourism indirectly serves to protect these forests (Aagesen 1998; González et al. 2013). After a long history of human destruction of A. araucana forests, which reduced its range to half its original distribution, Chile and Argentina now legally protect this endangered species. These ecosystems continue to be threatened by logging, fires, and extensive livestock use. These factors, and the potential threats posed by climate change, are among the main challenges to A. araucana conservation (González and Lara 2015).

AB  - Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 °C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5 %, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10 % at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6 % decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22 %. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajós is reduced by 31 % in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34 % over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27 % in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajós. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.

AB  - The Variability of American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS) Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere- Land Study (VOCALS) is an international research program focused upon improved understanding and modeling of the southeast Pacific (SEP) climate system on diurnal to inter annual time scales. The SEP is characterized by strong coastal ocean upwelling, the coldest sea surface temperatures (SST) at comparable latitudes, the planet's most extensive subtropical stratocumulus deck, and a high and steep cordillera to the east. The VOCALS program is built on several research activities in SEP climate research (Mechoso and Wood 2010). The preceding Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System (EPIC) provided important insight on the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)/cold-tongue complex and marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds over the SEP.

AB  - We present a detailed record from Lago Lepué to examine vegetation, climate and fire-regime changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in central-east Isla Grande de Chiloé (43°S), northwestern Patagonia. Precipitation in this region correlates with the intensity of the southern westerly winds (SWW), allowing reconstruction of past SWW behavior through precipitation-sensitive sensors. Recession from the LGM glacier margins exposed the central-east sector of Isla Grande de Chiloé by 17,800calyrBP, followed by the immediate colonization of pioneer cold-resistant herbs/shrubs and rapid establishment of closed-canopy Nothofagus forests by 17,000calyrBP. Broad-leaved temperate rainforests have persisted since then with compositional changes driven by changes in temperature, hydrologic balance and disturbance regimes. We detect low lake levels and enhanced fire activity between 800-2000, 4000-4300, ∼8000-11,000 and 16,100-17,800calyrBP, implying southward shifts and/or weaker SWW flow that alternated with cold, humid phases with muted fire activity. Covariation in paleoclimate trends revealed by the Lago Lepué record with tropical and Antarctic records since the LGM, suggests that the SWW have been a highly dynamic component of the climate system capable of linking climate changes from low- and high-southern latitudes during the Last Glacial termination and the current interglacial. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A method to predict vascular plant richness using spectral and textural variables in a heterogeneous wetland is presented. Plant richness was measured at 44 sampling plots in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland. Several spectral indices, first-order statistics (median and standard deviation), and second-order statistics [metrics of a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)] were extracted from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image and a Pleiades 1B image. We selected the most important variables for predicting richness using recursive feature elimination and then built a model using random forest regression. The final model was based on only two textural variables obtained from the GLCM and derived from the Landsat 8 image. An accurate predictive capability was reported ( R2=0.6; [Formula: see text]), highlighting the possibility of obtaining parsimonious models using textural variables. In addition, the results showed that the mid-resolution Landsat 8 image provided better predictors of richness than the high-resolution Pleiades image. This is the first study to generate a model for plant richness in a wetland ecosystem.

AB  - The age of organic material discharged by rivers provides information about its sources and carbon cycling processes within watersheds. Although elevated ages in fluvially transported organic matter are usually explained by erosion of soils and sedimentary deposits, it is commonly assumed that mainly young organic material is discharged from flat tropical watersheds due to their extensive plant cover and rapid carbon turnover. Here we present compound-specific radiocarbon data of terrigenous organic fractions from a sedimentary archive offshore the Congo River, in conjunction with molecular markers for methane-producing land cover reflecting wetland extent. We find that the Congo River has been discharging aged organic matter for several thousand years, with apparently increasing ages from the mid- to the Late Holocene. This suggests that aged organic matter in modern samples is concealed by radiocarbon from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. By comparison to indicators for past rainfall changes we detect a systematic control of organic matter sequestration and release by continental hydrology, mediating temporary carbon storage in wetlands. As aridification also leads to exposure and rapid remineralization of large amounts of previously stored labile organic matter, we infer that this process may cause a profound direct climate feedback that is at present underestimated in carbon cycle assessments.

AB  - The high Andes of western South America feature extreme ecological conditions that impose important physiological constraints on humans including high-elevation hypoxia and cold stress. This leads to questions regarding how these environments were colonized by the first waves of humans that reached them during the late Pleistocene. Based on previous research, and aided by 
human behavioral ecology principles, we assess hunter-gatherer behavioral strategies in the Andean highlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Specifically, we formulate three mobility strategies and their archaeological expectations and test these using technological and subsistence evidence from the six earliest well-dated highland sites in northern Chile. Our results 
suggest that all of the studied sites were temporarily occupied for hunting, processing animals, and toolkit maintenance. The sites also exhibit shared technological features within a curatorial strategy albeit with different occupation intensities. From this evidence, we infer that the initial occupations 
of the highlands were logistical and probably facilitated by increased local resource availability during a period of environmental amelioration.

AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are interlinked by primary production, respiration and decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems1. It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological activity is mainly driven by water availability6, 7, 8. The increase in aridity predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide9, 10, 11 may therefore threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the availability of essential nutrients12, 13, 14. Here we evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition12, 13, 14. Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key services provided by these ecosystems.

AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0–100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area.

AB  - The effective radiative forcings (including rapid adjustments) and feedbacks associated with an instantaneous quadrupling of the preindustrial CO<inf>2</inf> concentration and a counterbalancing reduction of the solar constant are investigated in the context of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The forcing and feedback parameters of the net energy flux, as well as its different components at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface, were examined in 10 Earth System Models to better understand the impact of solar radiation management on the energy budget. In spite of their very different nature, the feedback parameter and its components at the TOA and surface are almost identical for the two forcing mechanisms, not only in the global mean but also in their geographical distributions. This conclusion holds for each of the individual models despite intermodel differences in how feedbacks affect the energy budget. This indicates that the climate sensitivity parameter is independent of the forcing (when measured as an effective radiative forcing). We also show the existence of a large contribution of the cloudy-sky component to the shortwave effective radiative forcing at the TOA suggesting rapid cloud adjustments to a change in solar irradiance. In addition, the models present significant diversity in the spatial distribution of the shortwave feedback parameter in cloudy regions, indicating persistent uncertainties in cloud feedback mechanisms. ©2014.

AB  - In the framework of the World Meteorological Organisation's Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System, we evaluated the predictions of five state-of-the-art dust forecast models during an intense Saharan dust outbreak affecting western and northern Europe in April 2011. We assessed the capacity of the models to predict the evolution of the dust cloud with lead times of up to 72 h using observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and dust surface concentrations from a ground-based measurement network. In addition, the predicted vertical dust distribution was evaluated with vertical extinction profiles from the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). To assess the diversity in forecast capability among the models, the analysis was extended to wind field (both surface and profile), synoptic conditions, emissions and deposition fluxes. Models predict the onset and evolution of the AOD for all analysed lead times. On average, differences among the models are larger than differences among lead times for each individual model. In spite of large differences in emission and deposition, the models present comparable skill for AOD. In general, models are better in predicting AOD than near-surface dust concentration over the Iberian Peninsula. Models tend to underestimate the long-range transport towards northern Europe. Our analysis suggests that this is partly due to difficulties in simulating the vertical distribution dust and horizontal wind. Differences in the size distribution and wet scavenging efficiency may also account for model diversity in long-range transport.

T2  - Monthly Weather Review
AB  - Summertime [December-February (DJF)] precipitation over the western slopes of the subtropical Andes (32°-368°) accounts for less than 10% of the annual accumulation, but it mostly occurs as rain and may trigger landslides leading to serious damages. Based on 13 year of reanalysis, in situ observations, and satellite imagery, a synoptic climatology and physical diagnosis reveal two main weather types lead to distinct precipitation systems. The most frequent type (̃80% of the cases) occurs when a short-wave midlevel trough with weak winds and thermally driven mountain winds favor the development of convective precipitation during the daytime. The trough progresses northwest of a long-lasting warm ridge, which produces low-level easterly airflow that enhances its buoyancy as it moves over the arid land of western Argentina toward the Andes. The weak winds aloft facilitate the penetration of the moist easterly flow into the Andes. Midlevel flow coming from the west side of the Andes is decoupled from the low-level maritime air by a temperature inversion, and thus provides little moisture to support precipitation. The less frequent type (̃20% of the cases) occurs when a deep midlevel trough and strong westerly flow produces stratiform precipitation. This type has a baroclinic nature akin to winter storms, except that they are rare in summer and there is no evidence of a frontal passage at low levels. The lifting and cooling ahead of the trough erode the typical temperature inversion over the Pacific coast, and thus allows upslope transport of low-level marine air by the strong westerlies forming a precipitating cloud cap on the western slope of the Andes. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloé Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 ± 0.77 kg C m−2, which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.

TI  - Orographic Precipitation in Coastal Southern Chile: Mean Distribution, Temporal Variability, and Linear Contribution
AU  - Garreaud, R.

T2  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
AB  - The Nahuelbuta Mountains (NM) are a semielliptical massif 1300 m high in coastal southern Chile (37°–38°S) facing frontal storms that move from the Pacific. Mean precipitation between 900 and 1200 mm yr−1 is observed in the surrounding lowland, but river flow measurements suggest values ≥3000 mm yr−1 atop the mountains. To verify and characterize such marked orographic enhancement, 15 rain gauges were deployed around and over the NM. The observations were supplemented by a high-resolution WRF simulation and linear theory (LT) modeling during the winter of 2011. The estimated mean precipitation increases gradually from offshore (~1000 mm yr−1) to the north-facing foothills (2000 mm yr−1). The precipitation rapidly increases in the upslope sector to reach ~4000 mm yr−1 over the northern half of the NM elevated plateau, and decreases farther south to reach background values 20–30 km downstream of the mountains. The upstream (downstream) orographic enhancement (suppression) was relatively uniform among storms when considering event accumulations but varied substantially within each storm, with larger modifications during pre- and postfrontal stages and minor modifications during the brief but intense frontal passage. WRF results are in good agreement with observations in terms of seasonal and daily mean rainfall distributions, as well as temporal variability. Given its linear, steady-state formulation, the LT model cannot resolve rainfall variability at short (hourly) time scales, which in WRF is at least characterized by transient, mesoscale rainbands. Nonetheless, the rainbands are mobile so the accumulation field at monthly or longer time scales produced by the linear model is remarkably similar to its WRF counterpart.

AB  - The Rim Fire of 2013, the third largest area burned by fire recorded in California history, is simulated by a climate model coupled with a size-resolved aerosol model. Modeled aerosol mass, number, and particle size distribution are within variability of data obtained from multiple-airborne in situ measurements. Simulations suggest that Rim Fire smoke may block 4–6% of sunlight energy reaching the surface, with a dimming efficiency around 120–150 W m−2 per unit aerosol optical depth in the midvisible at 13:00–15:00 local time. Underestimation of simulated smoke single scattering albedo at midvisible by 0.04 suggests that the model overestimates either the particle size or the absorption due to black carbon. This study shows that exceptional events like the 2013 Rim Fire can be simulated by a climate model with 1° resolution with overall good skill, although that resolution is still not sufficient to resolve the smoke peak near the source region.

Cada uno de estos capítulos refleja el esfuerzo de sus autores por conectar distintos aspectos de los ecosistemas y paisajes con sus servicios y sus beneficiarios. Todos estos trabajos comparten el objetivo último de contribuir a recuperar la conciencia del valor de los sistemas naturales para el desarrollo sustentable de los pueblos de Latinoamérica y el Caribe, e incidir sobre la realidad para el logro de una relación más virtuosa entre naturaleza y sociedad. Ecosistemas naturales y transformados son fuente de agua, alimentos, materiales de construcción, medicinas. Los ecosistemas también contribuyen con nuestro bienestar regulando las condiciones ambientales en las que vivimos y llevamos a cabo nuestras actividades productivas. Los bosques y mares regulan la cantidad de gases de invernadero, los cuales a su vez afectan la temperatura promedio del planeta así como la frecuencia de sequías o de huracanes. Los ecosistemas regulan la cantidad de agua que escurre por los ríos, la recarga de los acuíferos, así como la calidad del agua. Los ecosistemas nos brindan además beneficios no tangibles, experiencias o capacidades, que surgen de la interacción entre seres humanos y ecosistemas. Nuestro bienestar físico y emocional, nuestra identidad, sentido de pertenencia e incluso capacidad cognitiva están influenciadas por nuestras interacciones con los ecosistemas. La capacidad de los ecosistemas para ofrecer distintos tipos de servicios se modifica a través de su manejo. Factores económicos, políticos, sociales, culturales, legales y de gobernanza subyacen a las decisiones que llevan a manejar los ecosistemas. La entrega de servicios a la sociedad redunda en cambios en su disponibilidad de bienes materiales, salud, seguridad, buenas relaciones sociales y capacidad de autodeterminación. El libro Servicios ecosistémicos hídricos: estudios de caso en América Latina y el Caribe es un reflejo de la situación de la región y el planeta en tomo a los servicios ecosistémicos. Es fundamental asegurar el mantenimiento de estos servicios para poder ir alcanzando un desarrollo más sustentable. El conjunto de trabajos compilados aquí ofrece una excelente panorámica de los principales desarrollos a la fecha y los retos por venir

Ambos sitios serían conchales efímeros con ocupaciones del Período Alfarero Temprano datadas entre los siglos XII y XIV, además de una ocupación histórica temprana en Abanico 3. Los resultados sugieren la posibilidad de que formas de vida tradicionales, originadas en el PAT de Chile Central, se mantengan en ciertos sectores hasta tiempos prehispánicos tardíos e incluso históricos tempranos, abriendo interesantes interrogantes acerca de las condiciones de coexistencia de estas poblaciones con otras sociedades más complejas tales como la Cultura Aconcagua, el Tawantinsuyu y el imperio hispano colonial.

AB  - AbstractFrom a theoretical approach based on political ecology and environmental justice, we assess how forestry development has generated socio-spatial dynamics of environmental degradation and water scarcity in southern Chile. Through historical-geographical and ethnographic methods, we discuss how and why the spread of forestry plantations has significantly influenced social and environmental degradation of the Mapuche's modes of living. In response, during recent decades a political articulation of a Mapuche social movement is observed. Their demands include land, autonomy, rights and opportunities to frame their own development strategies. Within the internal diversity of this movement, a key principle is ​​reversing the spread of environmental degradation by recovering the native forest and its natural water cycles, which have been disrupted significantly by the increasing of forestry plantations. We explore these dynamics of the Mapuche movement from an environmental justice approach.Key words: Forestry monoculture; water scarcity; Mapuche; water justice; natural commons

T2  - Research in Transportation Economics
AB  - The introduction in 2007 of a new public transport system in Santiago, Chile, brought to us an unexpected gift: the availability of Big Data; massive amounts of passive data obtained from technological devices installed to control the operation of buses and to administer the fare collection process. Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97% penetration rate.
We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - Most evaluations of the effectiveness of PAs have relied on indirect estimates based on comparisons between protected and unprotected areas. Such methods can be biased when protection is not randomly assigned. We add to the growing literature on the impact of PAs by answering the following research questions: What is the impact of Chilean PAs on deforestation which occurred between 1986 and 2011? How do estimates of the impact of PAs vary when using only public land as control units? We show that the characteristics of the areas in which protected and unprotected lands are located differ significantly. To satisfactorily estimate the effects of PAs, we use matching methods to define adequate control groups, but not as in previous research. We construct control groups using separately non-protected private areas and non-protected public lands. We find that PAs avoid deforestation when using unprotected private lands as valid controls, however results show no impact when the control group is based only on unprotected public land. Different land management regimes, and higher levels of enforcement inside public lands may reduce the opportunity to add additional conservation benefits when the national systems for PAs are based on the protection of previously unprotected public lands. Given that not all PAs are established to avoid deforestation, results also admit the potential for future studies to include other outcomes including forest degradation (not just deforestation), biodiversity, wildlife, primary forests (not forests in general), among others.

AB  - A multistructural object-based LiDAR approach to predict plant richness in complex structure forests is presented. A normalized LiDAR point cloud was split into four height ranges: 1) high canopies (points above 16 m); 2) middle-high canopies (8-16 m); 3) middle-low canopies (2-8 m); and 4) low canopies (0-2 m). A digital canopy model (DCM) was obtained from the full normalized LiDAR point cloud, and four pseudo-DCMs (pDCMs) were obtained from the split point clouds. We applied a multiresolution segmentation algorithm to the DCM and the four pDCMs to obtain crown objects. A partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) algorithm was applied to predict total vascular plant richness using object-based image analysis (OBIA) variables, derived from the delineated crown objects, and topographic variables, derived from a digital terrain model. Results showed that the object-based model was able to predict the total richness with an r2 of 0.64 and a root-mean-square error of four species. Topographic variables showed to be more important than the OBIA variables to predict richness. Furthermore, high-medium canopies (8-16 m) showed the biggest correlation with the total plant richness within the structural segments of the forest.

AU  - Carrasco, Cristina
AU  - Karstensen, Johannes
AU  - Farias, Laura
T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas principally produced by nitrification and denitrification in the marine environment. Observations were made in the eastern South Pacific (ESP), between 10° and 60°S, and ~75°–88°W, from intermediate waters targeting Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) at potential density of 27.0–27.1 kg m−3. Between 60° and 20°S, a gradual equatorward increase of N2O from 8 to 26 nmol L−1 was observed at density 27.0–27.1 kg m−3 where AAIW penetrates. Positive correlations were found between apparent N2O production (ΔN2O) and O2 utilization (AOU), and between ΔN2O and NO−3NO3−, which suggested that local N2O production is predominantly produced by nitrification. Closer to the equator, between 20° and 10°S at AAIW core, a strong N2O increase up to 75 nmol L−1 was observed. Because negative correlations were found between ΔN2O vs. NO−3NO3− and ΔN2O vs. N* (a Nitrogen deficit index) and because ΔN2O and AOU do not follow a linear trend, we suspect that, in addition to nitrification, denitrification also takes place in N2O cycling. By making use of water mass mixing analyses, we show that an increase in N2O occurs in the region where high oxygen from AAIW merges with low oxygen from Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW), creating favorable conditions for local N2O production. We conclude that the non-linearity in the relationship between N2O and O2 is a result of mixing between two water masses with very different source characteristics, paired with the different time frames of nitrification and denitrification processes that impact water masses en route before they finally meet and mix in the ESP region.

TI  - Importance of small-scale paleo-oceanographic conditions to interpret changes in size of California mussel (Mytilus californianus). Late Holocene, Santa Cruz island, California
AU  - Flores, Carola
T2  - Quaternary International
AB  - Several authors have highlighted the difficulties in disentangling human from natural effects when studying shellfish foraging strategies and archeo-malacogical records. In coastal settings, one of the reasons for this difficulty is the lack of understanding of small-scale oceanographic conditions and their influence on coastal and marine species used by people in the past. The present study evaluated the influence of environmental conditions on shellfish harvesting during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island (Southern California) considering small-scale nearshore oceanographic variability around the Island and its effect on M. californianus (main shellfish species exploited through prehistory along the coast of California). Fluctuations in size and abundance of M. californianus shells through time and local past sea surface temperature (SST) values from oxygen isotope analysis of mussel shells are correlated throughout the stratigraphy of two shell midden sites (2200–500 cal B.P.) nearby coasts with different paleo-oceanographic characteristics.
Despite the fact that human harvesting seems to have been the main force shaping length and availability of M. californianus, no clear evidence of human pressure was found on archaeological mussel assemblages. Results also show that fluctuations in regional SST records (Santa Barbara Basin marine core) do not represent local SST variations (oxygen isotope analyses on mussel shells), especially if the archaeological site is located on a coast exposed to strong and consistent upwelling activity.
By re-evaluating human impact on mussel beds during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island, the research presented here demonstrates the importance of considering small-scale nearshore oceanography for understanding the archaeological evidence of prehistoric human foraging on important intertidal shellfish species.

AB  - Adaptive plasticity in foraging of early life stages of marine fishes is highly relevant, particularly in environments such as the Antarctic inshore waters. In this study we analyzed the trophic habits, feeding success and selectivity of larval spiny plunderfish Harpagifer antarcticus (Osteichthyes: Harpagiferidae) collected weekly in austral summer 2014 and 2015 at Bahía Chile, Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands. Based on the stomach contents of 202 individuals ranging between 5.97 and 10.66 mm, the spiny plunderfish was omnivorous, with chain-forming diatom Thalassiosira minuscula, euphausiid eggs and copepodites as the main prey items. The feeding success, measured as prey number per gut and total volume per gut, and the trophic niche breadth were independent of the standard length. Only the maximum prey size (width) was positively correlated with larval size, suggesting a preference for larger prey as larvae grow. At the interannual scale, significant differences were only detected in the ingested prey per gut, with higher values during summer 2014. In this season, trophic niche breadth increased with larval size. At the weekly scale, and after storm winds from southeast and high turbulence in surface waters, H. antarcticus larvae switched their selective feeding based on large prey (i.e., copepodites) to a more opportunistic feeding strategy, relying on large abundance of small (i.e., T. minuscula) to medium-size prey (euphausiid eggs). The present results suggest that larval spiny plunderfish exhibit feeding behavior plasticity, ensuring higher feeding rates after major changes triggered by meteorological conditions in a shallow embayment of the South Shetland Islands.

AU  - Muñoz, Francisca
T2  - Bits de Ciencia
AB  - El tiempo y el clima afectan la forma en que vivimos y las decisiones que tomamos. La disponibilidad hídrica, actividades económicas, interacciones sociales, migraciones, planificación e implementación de políticas públicas a diferentes escalas, e incluso la biodiversidad del planeta se relacionan con las tendencias climáticas o con la recurrencia de eventos extremos y los escenarios futuros.

A nivel global, eventos meteorológicos extremos tales como sequías, tormentas de viento, olas de calor, inundaciones fluviales y costeras han aumentado considerablemente en las últimas décadas (ver Jennings 2011), y las proyecciones climáticas (IPCC, 2014) muestran que estos serán más frecuentes y severos. 
En nuestro país, por ejemplo, la sequía extrema y los aumentos de temperatura que hemos experimentado en los últimos seis años no tienen precedentes en el registro histórico. Esta condición se presenta en siete regiones con un déficit de precipitaciones cercano al 30% y en el contexto de la década más seca y cálida de los últimos 100 años. 
Pero, ¿cómo podemos realizar predicciones a largo plazo y así determinar la eventual recurrencia de algún evento, diferenciando la contribución antropogénica de la variabilidad natural? 
Sólo es posible si contamos con datos observados de larga data, robustos y confiables que sirvan de entrada a los modelos climáticos. 
En tanto, para predecir y generar alertas tempranas de eventos extremos –como aluviones, in-cendios forestales derivados de olas de calor, o tormentas inusuales– es también necesario contar con redes automáticas de monitoreo que recolecten, procesen y modelen estas observaciones en tiempo real.

AB  - Some morphological studies based on the comparisons between two or three species of Aegla indicate that, as an expression of sexual dimorphism, the cephalothorax is longer in males and wider at the posterior end in females. To assess whether this is a general trend, we performed a series of covariational analyses relating the length and posterior width of cephalothorax in 1,242 specimens of both sexes from 17 of the 19 species of Aegla reported from Chile. By using a covariable homologous for all individuals, it was shown that the bias toward females in the posterior cephalothoracic width is greater than the bias toward males in the cephalothoracic length. Additionally, both variables show positive phylogenetic signal, both in each trait individually and their male–female relationship. For the entire Chilean clade of Aegla, both variables showed a narrow covariation pattern influenced by the sex of the individuals. Furthermore, the phylogenetic signal both in each variable individually and the female–male relationships derived from directional phylogenetic comparative analyses suggests that this relationship is inherited by shared common ancestry, restricting their adaptive potential to most probably directions of change. However, within certain limits, this variability has important reproductive and behavioral implications that are directly associated with the fitness of the taxon.

Luego de las recomendaciones efectuadas por la OCDE en el sentido de fortalecer la institucionalidad ambiental (2005), el legislador dicta la Ley N°20.417 que introduce la reforma ambiental (2010) y la Ley N°20.600 que crea los Tribunales Ambientales (2012). La primera amplía el ámbito de aplicación de la participación ciudadana del sistema de evaluación de impacto ambiental, sin embargo es el trabajo jurisprudencial del Segundo Tribunal Ambiental el que permitirá comprender el real alcance de la modificación legislativa. Esta judicatura especializada  desarrolla nuevos estándares de participación ciudadana en el marco del proyecto de la Empresa de Ferrocarriles del Estado. Se trata de una interpretación amplia del principio en miras a una aplicación real y no únicamente formal del mismo, lo que contribuye al fortalecimiento de esta institución en relación al principio de acceso a la información y a la justicia en materia ambiental.

However, it also reveals the difficulties raised by its application. Justice, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities can be claimed by all Parties, sometimes with diametrically-opposed goals. Since the adoption of the Framework Convention (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the structure of global carbon emissions has changed considerably, in particular as a result of increased emissions from China. The principle, used as a shield by some and as a foil by others, is currently referred to frequently in difficult « post-2012 » and « post 2020 » negotiations, and its role is gradually changing.

AU  - Cuenca, Pablo

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - For many decades, protected areas (PAs) have been considered by decision makers and conservation practitioners as one of the most common policies to promote biodiversity conservation. Diverse studies have assessed the impact of conservation policies at global and regional levels by comparing deforestation rates between PAs and unprotected areas. Most of these studies are based on conventional methods and could overestimate the avoided deforestation of PAs by omitting from their analyses the lack of randomness in the allocation of forest protection.

We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable and testing the sensitivity of estimates of potential hidden biases. We used matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Ecuador's tropical Andean forest protected-area system between 1990 and 2008. We found that protection reduced deforestation in approximately 6% of the protected forests. These would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to estimate conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that this research will help decision-making in the framework of international climate change mitigation policies, such as REDD+.

TI  - “Climate change damages”, conceptualization of a legal notion with regard to reparation under international law
AU  - Kugler, Noémie Rachel
AU  - Moraga Sariego, Pilar
T2  - Climate Risk Management
AB  - The damages related to climate change are a concerning issue for the international community, as no country will escape the impacts of climate change. Indeed, it is a preoccupation for the countries (mostly vulnerable) that will suffer those damages, but also for the States that emitted greenhouse gases which fear to have to repair them. That’s why the international negotiation related to the climate regime use the ambiguous term “loss and damage” to design the impacts related to climate change.
The purpose of this article is to know if the term “loss and damage” is a useful one in view of reparation under international law or if it is necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion employed by the doctrine. More precisely, the central question is the following: why is it necessary to conceptualize the “climate change damage” notion?
Even though “loss and damage” could formally be a legal concept, it is substantially useless with regard to reparation under international law because it is too ambiguous.
Therefore, we judged necessary to clarify the concept of “climate change damage” used by the doctrine but that unfortunately defines it insufficiently. Indeed, it could be useful for the doctrine but also for the lawyers of vulnerable countries and the judges to dispose of a legal notion in order to consider the reparation of the damages related to climate change under international law. Consequently, we propose in this article a definition of climate change damage that could be useful with regard to reparation under international law.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a discipline that was born just under 30 years. In Latin America it is in a formation stage, with Chile as one of the countries that has led in some aspects of restoration. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art of Ecological Restoration (ER) in Chile. Specifically we aim to: i) a brief compilation of the first actions of ecological restoration developed in the country; ii) to identify the ecological restoration of forest ecosystems that have been or are being implemented; iii) to identify the organizations that have been involved; and iv) to outline the main challenges and opportunities of ER in the country. We found about 60 ER initiatives in the country, that are being developed by NGOs, government, forest companies and universities. Despite being many initiatives, the area covered by each one is rather small. However, there are commitments to expand it considerably. ER is increasingly beingtaught in universities. The challenges aimed primarily at generating a National and Regional ER Plans that includes various ways of funding.

AB  - El libro consta de 16 capítulos que son el resultado del trabajo colaborativo de la red ProAgua financiada por CYTED entre los años 2009 y 2012 y presenta estudios de caso de México, Costa Rica, Cuba, Paraguay, Argentina y Chile, involucrando a 52 autores y co-autores. Cada uno de estos capítulos refleja el esfuerzo de sus autores por conectar distintos aspectos de los ecosistemas y paisajes con sus servicios y sus beneficiarios. Todos estos trabajos comparten el objetivo último de contribuir a recuperar la conciencia del valor de los sistemas naturales para el desarrollo sustentable de los pueblos de Latinoamérica y el Caribe, e incidir sobre la realidad para el logro de una relación más virtuosa entre naturaleza y sociedad. Ecosistemas naturales y transformados son fuente de agua, alimentos, materiales de construcción, medicinas. Los ecosistemas también contribuyen con nuestro bienestar regulando las condiciones ambientales en las que vivimos y llevamos a cabo nuestras actividades productivas. Los bosques y mares regulan la cantidad de gases de invernadero, los cuales a su vez afectan la temperatura promedio del planeta así como la frecuencia de sequías o de huracanes. Los ecosistemas regulan la cantidad de agua que escurre por los ríos, la recarga de los acuíferos, así como la calidad del agua. Los ecosistemas nos brindan además beneficios no tangibles, experiencias o capacidades, que surgen de la interacción entre seres humanos y ecosistemas. Nuestro bienestar físico y emocional, nuestra identidad, sentido de pertenencia e incluso capacidad cognitiva están influenciadas por nuestras interacciones con los ecosistemas. La capacidad de los ecosistemas para ofrecer distintos tipos de servicios se modifica a través de su manejo. Factores económicos, políticos, sociales, culturales, legales y de gobernanza subyacen a las decisiones que llevan a manejar los ecosistemas. La entrega de servicios a la sociedad redunda en cambios en su disponibilidad de bienes materiales, salud, seguridad, buenas relaciones sociales y capacidad de autodeterminación. El libro Servicios ecosistémicos hídricos: estudios de caso en América Latina y el Caribe es un reflejo de la situación de la región y el planeta en tomo a los servicios ecosistémicos. Es fundamental asegurar el mantenimiento de estos servicios para poder ir alcanzando un desarrollo más sustentable. El conjunto de trabajos compilados aquí ofrece una excelente panorámica de los principales desarrollos a la fecha y los retos por venir

AB  - Este libro constituye una revisión y actualización de la primera edición del libro Ecología Forestal escrito hace ya más de 30 años, así como de los antecedentes sobre estructura y dinámica de bosques entregados hace 20 años en el texto Bosques Templados de Chile y Argentina. Como acertadamente se señala en el prólogo, en el marco del modelo esencialmente economicista en que vivimos, esta sociedad no reconoce, en parte porque lo ignora, que el manejo de los bosques con una base ecológica es necesario. Debemos asegurar que eso sea así y no perder de vista la importancia de los ecosistemas forestales y la necesidad de su conservación. Creemos que el contenido de este libro puede colaborar con ese propósito. La diversidad de temas incorporados se expresa en 19 capítulos que se refieren, entre otros, a la historia del nacimiento y desarrollo de la Ecología Forestal en Chile; las aves, y mamíferos del bosque; cambio climático; hidrobiología; sucesión y dinámica de bosques y la influencia de disturbios en los bosques templados de Chile y Argentina; la silvicultura y manejo de ecosistemas forestales; el manejo integrado de cuencas; los servicios ecosistémicos de los bosques nativos; la ecología de paisajes, restauración e invasiones de plantas en ecosistemas forestales; y la gobernanza del sector forestal chileno, enfatizando las tensiones y conflictos entre las fuerzas de mercado y las demandas ciudadanas.

AB  - Lakes are a nitrous oxide (N2O) source to the atmosphere, but the biogeochemical controls and microbial pathways of N2O production are not well understood. To trace microbial N2O production (denitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification) and consumption (denitrification) in two basins of Lake Lugano, we measured the concentrations and N and O isotope compositions of N2O, as well as the intramolecular 15N distribution, i.e., site preference (SP). Our results revealed differential N2O dynamics in the two lake basins, with N2O concentrations between 12 nmol L−1 and > 900 nmol L−1 in the holomictic South Basin, and significantly lower concentrations in the meromictic North Basin (<13 nmol L−1). In the South Basin, the isotope signatures reflected a complex combination of N2O production by nitrifying bacteria through hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation, N2O production through incomplete denitrification, and N2O reduction to N2, all occurring in close vicinity within the redox transition zone (RTZ). In the North Basin, in contrast, the N2O isotopomer signatures suggested that nitrifier denitrification was the main N2O source. The pronounced decrease in N2O concentrations to undetectable levels within the RTZ, in tandem with an increase in δ15N-N2O, δ18O-N2O, and SP indicated quantitative N2O consumption by microbial denitrification. In the northern basin this was primarily sulfide-dependent. The apparent N and O isotope enrichment factors associated with net N2O consumption were 15ε ≈ 3.2‰ and 18ε ≈ 8.6‰, respectively. The according 18O to 15N enrichment ratio (18ε: 15ε ≈ 2.5) is consistent with previous reports for microbial N2O reduction, underscoring its robust nature across environments.

AB  - Shell fishhooks have been found in several sites along the Pacific Coast of the Americas, but little is known about prehistoric workshops of these tools and the socio-economic context of their production and distribution. The present study provides new data about the production of mussel (Choromytilus chorus) shell fishing tools (MSFT) at Morro Colorado and Zapatero, two Middle Holocene sites on the coast of Taltal, northern Chile. The MSFT assemblages of the two sites suggest the existence of workshop areas and a specialized manufacture of C. chorus fishhooks associated with an increased dependence on fishing in local subsistence practices. Abundance and type of mussel shell fishing artifacts, preforms, and shell debris at these two shell midden sites are discussed to better understand Prehispanic workshops, the techniques used to work C. chorus shells, and the possible relationship between raw material acquisition, technological change and overall transformations in subsistence practices and levels of social complexity among Middle Holocene coastal groups along the northern coast of Chile.

Since the fossil-fuel emissions did not decrease during the period, this stalling implies the persistence of a strong sink, perhaps sustained for as long as a decade or more. Double-deconvolution analyses have attributed this sink to the ocean, conceivably as a response to the very strong El Niño event in 1940-1942. However, this explanation is questionable, as recent ocean CO2 data indicate that the range of variability in the ocean sink has been rather modest in recent decades, and El Niño events have generally led to higher growth rates of atmospheric CO2 due to the offsetting terrestrial response. Here, we use the most up-to-date information on the different terms of the carbon budget: fossil-fuel emissions, four estimates of land-use change (LUC) emissions, ocean uptake from two different reconstructions, and the terrestrial sink modelled by the TRENDY project to identify the most likely causes of the 1940s plateau. We find that they greatly overestimate atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the plateau period, as well as in the 1960s, in spite of giving a plausible explanation for most of the 20th century carbon budget, especially from 1970 onwards. The mismatch between reconstructions and observations during the CO2 plateau epoch of 1940-1950 ranges between 0.9 and 2.0P-1, depending on the LUC dataset considered. This mismatch may be explained by (i) decadal variability in the ocean carbon sink not accounted for in the reconstructions we used, (ii) a further terrestrial sink currently missing in the estimates by land-surface models, or (iii) LUC processes not included in the current datasets. Ocean carbon models from CMIP5 indicate that natural variability in the ocean carbon sink could explain an additional 0.5P-1 uptake, but it is unlikely to be higher. The impact of the 1940-1942 El Niño on the observed stabilization of atmospheric CO2 cannot be confirmed nor discarded, as TRENDY models do not reproduce the expected concurrent strong decrease in terrestrial uptake. Nevertheless, this would further increase the mismatch between observed and modelled CO2 growth rate during the CO2 plateau epoch. Tests performed using the OSCAR (v2.2) model indicate that changes in land use not correctly accounted for during the period (coinciding with drastic socioeconomic changes during the Second World War) could contribute to the additional sink required. Thus, the previously proposed ocean hypothesis for the 1940s plateau cannot be confirmed by independent data. Further efforts are required to reduce uncertainty in the different terms of the carbon budget during the first half of the 20th century and to better understand the long-term variability of the ocean and terrestrial CO2 sinks. © Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Este libro constituye una revisión y actualización de la primera edición del libro Ecología Forestal escrito hace ya más de 30 años, así como de los antecedentes sobre estructura y dinámica de bosques entregados hace 20 años en el texto Bosques Templados de Chile y Argentina. Como acertadamente se señala en el prólogo, en el marco del modelo esencialmente economicista en que vivimos, esta sociedad no reconoce, en parte porque lo ignora, que el manejo de los bosques con una base ecológica es necesario. Debemos asegurar que eso sea así y no perder de vista la importancia de los ecosistemas forestales y la necesidad de su conservación. Creemos que el contenido de este libro puede colaborar con ese propósito. La diversidad de temas incorporados se expresa en 19 capítulos que se refieren, entre otros, a la historia del nacimiento y desarrollo de la Ecología Forestal en Chile; las aves, y mamíferos del bosque; cambio climático; hidrobiología; sucesión y dinámica de bosques y la influencia de disturbios en los bosques templados de Chile y Argentina; la silvicultura y manejo de ecosistemas forestales; el manejo integrado de cuencas; los servicios ecosistémicos de los bosques nativos; la ecología de paisajes, restauración e invasiones de plantas en ecosistemas forestales; y la gobernanza del sector forestal chileno, enfatizando las tensiones y conflictos entre las fuerzas de mercado y las demandas ciudadanas.

AB  - We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system to study the impacts of biomass burning smoke from Central America on several tornado outbreaks occurring in the U.S. during spring. The model is configured with an aerosol-aware microphysics parameterization capable of resolving aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in a cost-efficient way for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. Primary aerosol emissions are included, and smoke emissions are constrained using an inverse modeling technique and satellite-based aerosol optical depth observations. Simulations turning on and off fire emissions reveal smoke presence in all tornado outbreaks being studied and show an increase in aerosol number concentrations due to smoke. However, the likelihood of occurrence and intensification of tornadoes is higher due to smoke only in cases where cloud droplet number concentration in low-level clouds increases considerably in a way that modifies the environmental conditions where the tornadoes are formed (shallower cloud bases and higher low-level wind shear). Smoke absorption and vertical extent also play a role, with smoke absorption at cloud-level tending to burn-off clouds and smoke absorption above clouds resulting in an increased capping inversion. Comparing these and WRF-Chem simulations configured with a more complex representation of aerosol size and composition and different optical properties, microphysics, and activation schemes, we find similarities in terms of the simulated aerosol optical depths and aerosol impacts on near-storm environments. This provides reliability on the aerosol-aware microphysics scheme as a less computationally expensive alternative to WRF-Chem for its use in applications such as NWP and cloud-resolving simulations.

AU  - Moreno, Patricio I.

T2  - Quaternary Science Reviews
AB  - We examine hydroclimate changes at centennial/millennial timescales since 16,000 yr BP in northwestern Patagonia based on the pollen and charcoal record from Lago El Salto, a small closed-basin lake located in the Chilean Lake District (41°38′48.02″S, 73° 5′48.42″W). We observe cold/wet conditions between 14,500–16,000 yr BP, followed by further cooling with increased precipitation until 13,000 yr BP, enhanced precipitation seasonality and/or variability between 11,600–13,000 yr BP, and an extended warm-and-dry interval between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP with peak paleofire activity. Colder-and-wetter than present conditions and muted paleofire activity prevail between 5300 and 7600 yr BP, followed by alternating cold/wet and centennial-scale warm/dry phases starting at 5300 yr BP with three conspicuous megadroughts since 2500 yr BP. The most recent megadrought occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly.

We identify a cold reversal that spans the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and the Younger Dryas (YD) chrons with stronger-than-present westerly influence during the former and enhanced variability during the latter. These results extend the northern limit of strong cooling and increase in precipitation during the ACR and the southern limit of influence of strong hydrologic variations during the YD in terrestrial environments, suggesting an overlap in the spheres of influence of processes originating from southern and northern polar latitudes. An extended warm southern westerly wind (SWW)-minimum interval is evident between 7600 and 11,300 yr BP, followed by a rapid shift to cool-moist conditions between 5300 and 7600 yr BP brought by a mid-Holocene SWW maximum. Since then we observe centennial-scale hydroclimate variability, which has driven biodiversity and fire-regime shifts of evergreen temperate rainforests.

AB  - A validation of four satellite daily precipitation estimates at a spatial resolution of 0.25° is performed over the subtropical Andes, an area of highly complex topography: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, 3B42 V7 and RT), the Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) and the Hydro-Estimator (HYDRO). Remote mountainous regions represent a major challenge for these satellite data products and for studies examining their quality with surface data.
For the assessment of the satellite products, a period of seven years from January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2010 was considered. Different statistics were analyzed considering their variability in the study area and identifying their main differences between the warm and cold seasons. The results indicate a decrease in winter errors which coincides with the wet season over the windward side of the Andes. Also, a significant underestimation of precipitation is observed for all estimates throughout the period analyzed.
The analysis with respect to terrain height shows a greater dependence of errors with topography for all the algorithms that combine infrared and passive microwave data, HYDRO providing the most stable result. The main limitations of the estimates associated with the type of precipitating event and their location relative to the orography are assessed.
Finally, the analysis of two intense precipitation events is presented and allows the assessment of the latest advances in satellite derived estimates with the launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement.

AB  - Sediment depositional patterns along the upper continental slope of the northern South China Sea (SCS) have been studied using two sediment cores (GeoB16601-6, 20°09.07′N, 116°14.38′E, 1012 m water depth and GeoB16602-4, 18°57.12′N, 113°42.64′E, 951 m water depth) recovered during RV SONNE Cruise SO-221 “INVERS”. Sediment cores were analyzed for bulk sediment element composition by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and clay mineral assemblage by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The bulk sediment element and the clay mineral compositions of the two cores suggest similar depositional patterns between 50 kyr BP and ~ 29 kyr BP, and ~ 14 kyr BP to present, but a clear difference in depositional patterns during the last glacial and deglacial (~ 29–14 kyr BP) when sea level was below − 90 m. Between ~ 29–14 kyr BP, a higher kaolinite percentage in core GeoB16602-4 in comparison to core GeoB16601-6 is interpreted to reflect a higher contribution of clay supplied by the Pearl River to core site GeoB16602-4. In contrast, core GeoB16601-6 received less Pearl River supplied clayey material during the same period. When the sea level was below − 90 m during the last glacial lowstand, the detrital fine-grained materials supplied by the Pearl River were mostly transported by coastal currents to the southwest, resulting in a higher contribution of Pearl River discharged material at site GeoB16602-4 than at site GeoB16601-6. We suggest that sea-level induced modifications of the land-ocean distribution together with changes in the palaeo-physiographic conditions, such as the proximity of the palaeo-rivers to the individual core sites might be responsible for the different sediment depositional patterns in the study area. Thus, the overriding control of sea-level induced changes on the sediment depositional environment might mask climate-related changes in sediment depositional pattern in the northern SCS.

AB  - This chapter describes the methodology used to analyse climate scenarios and their impact on hydro-meteorological variables in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile (MRS) and the results thereof. Using a downscaling methodology for future IPCC A2 and B1 scenarios (and B2 for stream flow), temperature, precipitation and secondary variable trends are estimated for the 2045–2065 time frame. The findings suggest that Santiago will be a drier and hotter city in the near future and have a high number of days with extreme temperatures. Lower precipitation rates are expected to lead to decreasing magnitudes in the stream flow of the two main rivers, Maipo and Mapocho, particularly in the summer months. Based on the data presented below, expected climate change impacts are analysed and adaptation needs identified for the MRS.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the less prone environments for plant invasions, nevertheless a growing number of non-native species have been registered in the last decades with negative effects on native flora. Here we assessed adaptive phenotypic plasticity in three photoprotective traits (non-photochemical quenching, total soluble sugars, and de-epoxidation state of xanthophylls cycle), and fitness-related traits (maximum quantum yield, photosynthetic rate and total biomass) in the invasive species Poa annua and Deschampsia antarctica under current conditions of water availability and those projected by climate change models. In addition, two manipulative experiments in controlled and field conditions were conducted to evaluate the competitive ability and survival of both species under current and climate change conditions. Moreover, we performed an experiment with different water availabilities to assess cell damage as a potential mechanism involved in the competitive ability deployed in both species. Finally, was assessed the plasticity and biomass of both species subject to factorial abiotic scenarios (water × temperature, and water × nutrients) ranging from current to climate change condition. Overall, results showed that P. annua had greater phenotypic plasticity in photoprotective strategies, higher performance, and greater competitive ability and survival than D. antarctica under current and climate change conditions. Also, cell damage, assessed by lipid peroxidation, was significantly greater in D. antarctica when grown in presence of P. annua compared when grown alone. Finally, P. annua showed a greater plasticity and biomass than D. antarctica under the factorial abiotic scenarios, being more evident under a climate change scenario (i.e., higher soil moisture). Our study suggests that the high adaptive plasticity and competitive ability deployed by P. annua under current and climate change conditions allows it to cope with harsh abiotic conditions and could help explain its successful invasion in the Antarctica.

T2  - Energía, cambio climático y sustentabilidad: una mirada desde el derecho
A2  - Moraga Sariego, P.
AB  - Uno de los grandes problemas que afecta a la humanidad en la actualidad es el fenómeno del cambio climático, provocado según el informe del Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambio Climático, IPCC, en sus siglas en inglés (intergovernmental panel on Climate Change) de 2007 por la actividad humana. Los impactos que genera este fenómeno son a la vez económicos, sociales y ambientales. Desde un punto de vista económico, el Informe STERN (2006) concluye que “los beneficios de acciones enérgicas y tempranas superan con creces los costes económicos de la inacción” y cuantifica los daños generados como consecuencia de este fenómeno en 20% o más del PIB global anual. En este sentido se realza el rol que jugarán las inversiones en la evolución de esta problemática global en la segunda mitad del siglo. En materia ambiental y social, el mismo informe advierte sobre las dificultades de acceso a ciertos recursos naturales esenciales, dada la escasez provocada por el cambio climático en materia de recursos hídricos, producción de alimentos y el estado del medio ambiente mundial. En este contexto, el sector energía aparece como uno de los principales responsables de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero a la atmósfera, a semejanza de lo que ocurre a nivel nacional en el caso chileno. Respondiendo a esta realidad global y nacional, la presente obra constituye un trabajo mancomunado de destacados académicos extranjeros y nacionales e investigadores en formación, que aportan a través de su propia experiencia nacional una mirada sobre las problemáticas jurídicas planteadas en el marco del desarrollo energético, la problemática del cambio climático y su relación con la protección del medio ambiente, desde la perspectiva propuesta por el desarrollo sustentable.

AB  - The 2009 United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen is often represented as a watershed in global climate politics, when the diplomatic efforts to negotiate a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol failed and was replaced by a fragmented and decentralized climate governance order. In the post-Copenhagen landscape the top-down universal approach to climate governance has gradually given way to a more complex, hybrid and dispersed political landscape involving multiple actors, arenas and sites. The Handbook contains contributions from more than 50 internationally leading scholars and explores the latest trends and theoretical developments of the climate governance scholarship.

AB  - Stable isotope analyses have become an essential tool for several archaeological problems. They can be made in different materials, depending on the type of analysis and research questions. Analyses commonly used in archaeology correspond to carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), sulfur (δ34S) and strontium (δ87Sr) for paleodietaries inferences; oxygen (δ18O), hydrogen (δ2H), sulfur (δ34S) and strontium (δ87Sr) for paleoenvironmental reconstructions,
mobility patterns and migration. Nitrogen (δ15N) and oxygen (δ18O) to infer patterns of breastfeeding and weaning. The application of stable isotopes in archaeology has allowed a direct biochemical analysis in human remains and their ecological environment, and has revolutionizing archaeological and bio-anthropological research.

AB  - El libro consta de 16 capítulos que son el resultado del trabajo colaborativo de la red ProAgua financiada por CYTED entre los años 2009 y 2012 y presenta estudios de caso de México, Costa Rica, Cuba, Paraguay, Argentina y Chile, involucrando a 52 autores y co-autores. Cada uno de estos capítulos refleja el esfuerzo de sus autores por conectar distintos aspectos de los ecosistemas y paisajes con sus servicios y sus beneficiarios. Todos estos trabajos comparten el objetivo último de contribuir a recuperar la conciencia del valor de los sistemas naturales para el desarrollo sustentable de los pueblos de Latinoamérica y el Caribe, e incidir sobre la realidad para el logro de una relación más virtuosa entre naturaleza y sociedad. Ecosistemas naturales y transformados son fuente de agua, alimentos, materiales de construcción, medicinas. Los ecosistemas también contribuyen con nuestro bienestar regulando las condiciones ambientales en las que vivimos y llevamos a cabo nuestras actividades productivas. Los bosques y mares regulan la cantidad de gases de invernadero, los cuales a su vez afectan la temperatura promedio del planeta así como la frecuencia de sequías o de huracanes. Los ecosistemas regulan la cantidad de agua que escurre por los ríos, la recarga de los acuíferos, así como la calidad del agua. Los ecosistemas nos brindan además beneficios no tangibles, experiencias o capacidades, que surgen de la interacción entre seres humanos y ecosistemas. Nuestro bienestar físico y emocional, nuestra identidad, sentido de pertenencia e incluso capacidad cognitiva están influenciadas por nuestras interacciones con los ecosistemas. La capacidad de los ecosistemas para ofrecer distintos tipos de servicios se modifica a través de su manejo. Factores económicos, políticos, sociales, culturales, legales y de gobernanza subyacen a las decisiones que llevan a manejar los ecosistemas. La entrega de servicios a la sociedad redunda en cambios en su disponibilidad de bienes materiales, salud, seguridad, buenas relaciones sociales y capacidad de autodeterminación. El libro Servicios ecosistémicos hídricos: estudios de caso en América Latina y el Caribe es un reflejo de la situación de la región y el planeta en tomo a los servicios ecosistémicos. Es fundamental asegurar el mantenimiento de estos servicios para poder ir alcanzando un desarrollo más sustentable. El conjunto de trabajos compilados aquí ofrece una excelente panorámica de los principales desarrollos a la fecha y los retos por venir

AB  - Este libro constituye una revisión y actualización de la primera edición del libro Ecología Forestal escrito hace ya más de 30 años, así como de los antecedentes sobre estructura y dinámica de bosques entregados hace 20 años en el texto Bosques Templados de Chile y Argentina. Como acertadamente se señala en el prólogo, en el marco del modelo esencialmente economicista en que vivimos, esta sociedad no reconoce, en parte porque lo ignora, que el manejo de los bosques con una base ecológica es necesario. Debemos asegurar que eso sea así y no perder de vista la importancia de los ecosistemas forestales y la necesidad de su conservación. Creemos que el contenido de este libro puede colaborar con ese propósito. La diversidad de temas incorporados se expresa en 19 capítulos que se refieren, entre otros, a la historia del nacimiento y desarrollo de la Ecología Forestal en Chile; las aves, y mamíferos del bosque; cambio climático; hidrobiología; sucesión y dinámica de bosques y la influencia de disturbios en los bosques templados de Chile y Argentina; la silvicultura y manejo de ecosistemas forestales; el manejo integrado de cuencas; los servicios ecosistémicos de los bosques nativos; la ecología de paisajes, restauración e invasiones de plantas en ecosistemas forestales; y la gobernanza del sector forestal chileno, enfatizando las tensiones y conflictos entre las fuerzas de mercado y las demandas ciudadanas.

Los autores nos invitan a desmenuzar las organizaciones sociales y la influencia que tienen en nuestras vidas, determinando el actuar social y valórico. Una necesaria revisión que nos acerca a entender la importancia de contar con ellas, de conocerlas, y de comprender el lugar que se les atribuye para conducir nuestros propios intereses y necesidades.

AB  - Este libro contiene una puesta al día de lo que se sabe acerca de los pueblos que habitaron lo que actualmente es el territorio de Chile, antes de la llegada de los conquistadores españoles. En trece capítulos preparados por destacados especialistas en cada uno de los temas tratados, el lector asistirá a la llegada de los primeros pobladores hace unos 13.000 años; a la epopeya del descubrimiento de los muy diversos territorios de este largo y angosto país, marcado por desiertos, bosques, nieves y hielos, con sólo dos elementos comunes: la majestad de la cordillera de los Andes y el océano Pacífico, fuente inagotable de recursos. Después de conocer a los diversos cazadores y recolectores del mar y de la tierra, se describen los primeros pasos de los pueblos hacia la domesticación de plantas y animales, al nacimiento de tecnologías necesarias para la sobrevivencia y a la formación de formas complejas de vida social. Termina esta obra cuando parte importante de lo que hoy es Chile queda bajo el extenso imperio Inca del Tawantinsuyo.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a rapidly growing discipline that encompasses a wide range of activities and brings together practitioners and theoreticians from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, ranging from volunteer backyard restorationists to highly trained academic scientists and professional consultants. This book offers a comprehensive and coherent account of the field for everyone who initiates, finances, designs, administers, issues government permits for, manages, and implements ecological restoration projects, and all those who serve in supportive roles. Originally published in 2007, this revised and reorganized edition brings the book up to date with new developments and current trends in the field.  The book also includes case studies and Virtual Field Trips around the world that illustrate points made in the book with on-the-ground information from those who were intimately involved with the projects described. Throughout, ecological restoration is conceived as a holistic endeavor, one that addresses issues of ecological degradation, biodiversity loss, personal engagement, and sustainability science simultaneously, and draws upon cultural resources and local skills and knowledge in restoration work.

AB  - Uno de los grandes problemas que afecta a la humanidad en la actualidad es el fenómeno del cambio climático, provocado según el informe del Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambio Climático, IPCC, en sus siglas en inglés (intergovernmental panel on Climate Change) de 2007 por la actividad humana. Los impactos que genera este fenómeno son a la vez económicos, sociales y ambientales. Desde un punto de vista económico, el Informe STERN (2006) concluye que “los beneficios de acciones enérgicas y tempranas superan con creces los costes económicos de la inacción” y cuantifica los daños generados como consecuencia de este fenómeno en 20% o más del PIB global anual. En este sentido se realza el rol que jugarán las inversiones en la evolución de esta problemática global en la segunda mitad del siglo. En materia ambiental y social, el mismo informe advierte sobre las dificultades de acceso a ciertos recursos naturales esenciales, dada la escasez provocada por el cambio climático en materia de recursos hídricos, producción de alimentos y el estado del medio ambiente mundial. En este contexto, el sector energía aparece como uno de los principales responsables de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero a la atmósfera, a semejanza de lo que ocurre a nivel nacional en el caso chileno. Respondiendo a esta realidad global y nacional, la presente obra constituye un trabajo mancomunado de destacados académicos extranjeros y nacionales e investigadores en formación, que aportan a través de su propia experiencia nacional una mirada sobre las problemáticas jurídicas planteadas en el marco del desarrollo energético, la problemática del cambio climático y su relación con la protección del medio ambiente, desde la perspectiva propuesta por el desarrollo sustentable.

AB  - Over the last few years, numerical prediction of dust aerosol concentration has become prominent at several research and operational weather centres due to growing interest from diverse stakeholders, such as solar energy plant managers, health professionals, aviation and military authorities and policymakers. Dust prediction in numerical weather prediction-type models faces a number of challenges owing to the complexity of the system. At the centre of the problem is the vast range of scales required to fully account for all of the physical processes related to dust. Another limiting factor is the paucity of suitable dust observations available for model, evaluation and assimilation. This chapter discusses in detail numerical prediction of dust with examples from systems that are currently providing dust forecasts in near real-time or are part of international efforts to establish daily provision of dust forecasts based on multi-model ensembles. The various models are introduced and described along with an overview on the importance of dust prediction activities and a historical perspective. Assimilation and evaluation aspects in dust prediction are also discussed.

AB  - Este libro constituye una revisión y actualización de la primera edición del libro Ecología Forestal escrito hace ya más de 30 años, así como de los antecedentes sobre estructura y dinámica de bosques entregados hace 20 años en el texto Bosques Templados de Chile y Argentina. Como acertadamente se señala en el prólogo, en el marco del modelo esencialmente economicista en que vivimos, esta sociedad no reconoce, en parte porque lo ignora, que el manejo de los bosques con una base ecológica es necesario. Debemos asegurar que eso sea así y no perder de vista la importancia de los ecosistemas forestales y la necesidad de su conservación. Creemos que el contenido de este libro puede colaborar con ese propósito. La diversidad de temas incorporados se expresa en 19 capítulos que se refieren, entre otros, a la historia del nacimiento y desarrollo de la Ecología Forestal en Chile; las aves, y mamíferos del bosque; cambio climático; hidrobiología; sucesión y dinámica de bosques y la influencia de disturbios en los bosques templados de Chile y Argentina; la silvicultura y manejo de ecosistemas forestales; el manejo integrado de cuencas; los servicios ecosistémicos de los bosques nativos; la ecología de paisajes, restauración e invasiones de plantas en ecosistemas forestales; y la gobernanza del sector forestal chileno, enfatizando las tensiones y conflictos entre las fuerzas de mercado y las demandas ciudadanas.

AB  - El libro consta de 16 capítulos que son el resultado del trabajo colaborativo de la red ProAgua financiada por CYTED entre los años 2009 y 2012 y presenta estudios de caso de México, Costa Rica, Cuba, Paraguay, Argentina y Chile, involucrando a 52 autores y co-autores. Cada uno de estos capítulos refleja el esfuerzo de sus autores por conectar distintos aspectos de los ecosistemas y paisajes con sus servicios y sus beneficiarios. Todos estos trabajos comparten el objetivo último de contribuir a recuperar la conciencia del valor de los sistemas naturales para el desarrollo sustentable de los pueblos de Latinoamérica y el Caribe, e incidir sobre la realidad para el logro de una relación más virtuosa entre naturaleza y sociedad. Ecosistemas naturales y transformados son fuente de agua, alimentos, materiales de construcción, medicinas. Los ecosistemas también contribuyen con nuestro bienestar regulando las condiciones ambientales en las que vivimos y llevamos a cabo nuestras actividades productivas. Los bosques y mares regulan la cantidad de gases de invernadero, los cuales a su vez afectan la temperatura promedio del planeta así como la frecuencia de sequías o de huracanes. Los ecosistemas regulan la cantidad de agua que escurre por los ríos, la recarga de los acuíferos, así como la calidad del agua. Los ecosistemas nos brindan además beneficios no tangibles, experiencias o capacidades, que surgen de la interacción entre seres humanos y ecosistemas. Nuestro bienestar físico y emocional, nuestra identidad, sentido de pertenencia e incluso capacidad cognitiva están influenciadas por nuestras interacciones con los ecosistemas. La capacidad de los ecosistemas para ofrecer distintos tipos de servicios se modifica a través de su manejo. Factores económicos, políticos, sociales, culturales, legales y de gobernanza subyacen a las decisiones que llevan a manejar los ecosistemas. La entrega de servicios a la sociedad redunda en cambios en su disponibilidad de bienes materiales, salud, seguridad, buenas relaciones sociales y capacidad de autodeterminación. El libro Servicios ecosistémicos hídricos: estudios de caso en América Latina y el Caribe es un reflejo de la situación de la región y el planeta en tomo a los servicios ecosistémicos. Es fundamental asegurar el mantenimiento de estos servicios para poder ir alcanzando un desarrollo más sustentable. El conjunto de trabajos compilados aquí ofrece una excelente panorámica de los principales desarrollos a la fecha y los retos por venir

AB  - La dégradation de l’environnement constitue un enjeu incontournable pour le droit. 
Pour y faire face, tous les instruments juridiques sont mobilisés. Parmi eux, jouant un rôle essentiel comme outil de gestion des risques environnementaux et de protection de l’environnement, le contrat occupe une place essentielle en droit français et dans un grand nombre de droits étrangers. Permettant de lutter contre des pollutions spécifiques ou globales, de préserver certaines ressources naturelles et la qualité de vie des habitants, de gérer les conséquences néfastes de la dégradation de l’environnement pour l’homme et la nature, conclus entre des personnes publiques et/ou privées (État, entreprises, propriétaires, ONG, etc.), résultant de certains dispositifs juridiques de droit interne, international ou européen, ou créés par les destinataires eux mêmes, les contrats environnementaux recouvrent aujourd’hui une grande diversité. Portant un regard local et global sur les relations contrats/environnement, le but de cet ouvrage est de mettre au jour l’importance prise par le contrat environnemental dans tout un ensemble de droits étrangers pour, in fine, parvenir à un enrichissement des techniques françaises de protection de l’environnement. Les contributions réunies dans cet ouvrage sont le fruit d’une recherche concernant « le contrat et l’environnement » soutenue par la Mission de recherche Droit et Justice et dirigée par Mathilde Hautereau-Boutonnet.

AB  - Little is known about the bioavailability of iron (Fe) in natural dusts and the impact of dust mineralogy on Fe utilization by photosynthetic organisms. Variation in the supply of bioavailable Fe to the ocean has the potential to influence the global carbon cycle by modulating primary production in the Southern Ocean. Much of the dust deposited across the Southern Ocean is sourced from South America, particularly Patagonia, where the waxing and waning of past and present glaciers generate fresh glaciogenic material that contrasts with aged and chemically weathered nonglaciogenic sediments. We show that these two potential sources of modern-day dust are mineralogically distinct, where glaciogenic dust sources contain mostly Fe(II)-rich primary silicate minerals, and nearby nonglaciogenic dust sources contain mostly Fe(III)-rich oxyhydroxide and Fe(III) silicate weathering products. In laboratory culture experiments, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a well-studied coastal model diatom, grows more rapidly, and with higher photosynthetic efficiency, with input of glaciogenic particulates compared to that of nonglaciogenic particulates due to these differences in Fe mineralogy. Monod nutrient accessibility models fit to our data suggest that particulate Fe(II) content, rather than abiotic solubility, controls the Fe bioavailability in our Fe fertilization experiments. Thus, it is possible for this diatom to access particulate Fe in dusts by another mechanism besides uptake of unchelated Fe (Fe?) dissolved from particles into the bulk solution. If this capability is widespread in the Southern Ocean, then dusts deposited to the Southern Ocean in cold glacial periods are likely more bioavailable than those deposited in warm interglacial periods.

AB  - There is renewed interest in the use of native tree species in ecosystem restoration for their biodiversity benefits. Growing native tree species in production systems (e.g. plantation forests and subsistence agriculture) can also ensure landscape functionality and support for human livelihoods. Achieving these full benefits requires consideration of genetic aspects that are often neglected, such as suitability of germplasm to the site, quality and quantity of the genetic pool used and regeneration potential. Understanding the extent and nature of gene flow across fragmented agro-ecosystems is also crucial to successful ecosystem restoration. We review the role of genetic considerations in a wide range of ecosystem restoration activities involving trees and evaluate how different approaches take, or could take, genetic aspects into account, leading towards the identification and selection of the most appropriate methods.

T2  - Marine Policy
AB  - During the past decade, global environmental policy discussions have encouraged countries to engage in an ecosystem approach to managing the oceans. An ecosystem approach involves the integrated management of species, other natural services, and the multiple uses of the coast. Improving ecosystem based management efforts requires a better understanding of how it is included within national level policies that influence marine resource management. Chile has committed to implement international recommendations to include ecosystem based management. This study operationalizes an approach to assess the extent to which ecosystem based management is being implemented at national scales through the synthesis of agenda setting documents and national level policy/regulatory responses. The study specifically searches for ecosystem based management principles, as defined by the Convention of Biological Diversity in State of the Nation presidential speeches, national sectorial policies, national decrees and national programs issued between 1990 and 2014 (n = 1335 documents). Results show that although national level policies in Chile increasingly share common grounds with ecosystem based management principles, the overall approach is poorly mainstreamed into agenda setting speeches and reports. Working with existing institutional settings and institutional capacity are key features to maintain trajectories for the implementation of ecosystem based management in national policies. The approach presented complements research on marine policy implementation by effectively informing how national level policies can be analyzed under the lens of ecosystem based management.

AB  - On March 24–26, 2015, the Chilean city of Copiapó (27° 22′ S, 70° 20′ W), located in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, suffered an intense flooding brought by an extreme, unique rainfall event with a 35-year record of daily precipitation. A receptor model (positive matrix factorization, version 5) analysis, applied to ambient PM10 chemical speciation from three short-term sampling campaigns, resolved four sources: crustal/road dust, sea salt, secondary sulfates, and emissions from Paipote copper smelter located 8 km east of Copiapó. Wind trajectories computed with US NOAA’s Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) supported the above source identification and explained variability in source contributions. It was found that crustal/road dust increased 50 μg/m3, in April 8–10, 2015, as compared with values in November 2014 and October–November 2015, respectively. This was the dominant PM10 source after the flooding and before debris were cleaned up, being on order of magnitude higher that the other source contributions. The Paipote copper smelter contributed with primary PM10 emissions and secondary sulfates; this combined contribution averaged 11.8 μg/m3. Sea salt contributions contributed an average of 3.3 μg/m3. In normal conditions, crustal/road dust averaged 2.9 μg/m3, but the other resolved sources also contributed with crustal elements as their emissions are transported by winds to Copiapó. The positive matrix factorization solution included an unresolved concentration of 7.4 μg/m3. The small number of samples and the lack of measurements of nitrate, ammonia, and organic and elemental carbon may explain this result. Hence, sources such as secondary nitrates and combustion sources plus fugitive dust from sources surrounding Copiapó might be included in that unresolved concentration.

AB  - We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations at 0."2 (25 au) resolution of Elias 2-24, one of the largest andbrightest protoplanetary disks in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud, and we report the presence of three partiallyresolved concentric gaps located at ∼20, 52, and 87 au from the star. We perform radiative transfer modeling of thedisk to constrain its surface density and temperature radial profile and place the disk structure in the context ofmechanisms capable of forming narrow gaps such as condensation fronts and dynamical clearing by activelyforming planets. In particular, we estimate the disk temperature at the locations of the gaps to be 23, 15, and 12 K(at 20, 52, and 87 au, respectively), very close to the expected snowlines of CO (23-28 K) and N2 (12-15 K).Similarly, by assuming that the widths of the gaps correspond to 4-8x the Hill radii of forming planets (assuggested by numerical simulations), we estimate planet masses in the range of 0.2-1.5 MJup, 1.0-8.0 MJup, and 0.02-0.15 MJup for the inner, middle, and outer gap, respectively. Given the surface density profile of the disk, theamount of missing mass at the location of each one of these gaps (between 4 and 20 MJup) is more than sufficientto account for the formation of such planets.

AB  - The most critical question for climate research is no longer about the problem, but about how to facilitate the transformative changes necessary to avoid catastrophic climate-induced change. Addressing this question, however, will require massive upscaling of research that can rapidly enhance learning about transformations. Ten essentials for guiding action-oriented transformation and energy research are therefore presented, framed in relation to second-order science. They include: (1) Focus on transformations to low-carbon, resilient living; (2) Focus on solution processes; (3) Focus on ‘how to’ practical knowledge; (4) Approach research as occurring from within the system being intervened; (5) Work with normative aspects; (6) Seek to transcend current thinking; (7) Take a multi-faceted approach to understand and shape change; (8) Acknowledge the value of alternative roles of researchers; (9) Encourage second-order experimentation; and (10) Be reflexive. Joint application of the essentials would create highly adaptive, reflexive, collaborative and impact-oriented research able to enhance capacity to respond to the climate challenge. At present, however, the practice of such approaches is limited and constrained by dominance of other approaches. For wider transformations to low carbon living and energy systems to occur, transformations will therefore also be needed in the way in which knowledge is produced and used.

AB  - Centennial-scale mineral dust peaks in last glacial Greenland ice cores match the timing of lowest Greenland temperatures, yet little is known of equivalent changes in dust-emitting regions, limiting our understanding of dust−climate interaction. Here, we present the most detailed and precise age model for European loess dust deposits to date, based on 125 accelerator mass spectrometry14C ages from Dunaszekcso, } Hungary. The record shows that variations in glacial dust deposition variability on centennial–millennial timescales in east central Europe and Greenland were synchronous within uncertainty. We suggest that precipitation and atmospheric circulation changes were likely the major influences on European glacial dust activity and propose that European dust emissions were modulated by dominant phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, which had a major influence on vegetation and local climate of European dust source regions.

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - Payments for Ecosystem Services programmes represent an important conservation policy worldwide. Despite their popularity, there is still a shortage of evidence regarding whether or not these schemes improve quality of life and generate desired behavioural changes. In this paper, we use a dataset from participants that enrolled in a conservation program on 2007, and from non-participants in the same program. Mexican indigenous communities were interviewed to evaluate program impacts on a range of land use and socio-economic variables between 2007 and 2013. In response to the theory that perceptions of ecosystem services mediate changes in behaviour regarding conservation, we seek to test whether participation in the programme makes it more likely for respondents to identify a higher number of ecosystem services obtained from the forest. Our results are in line with recent socio-economic evaluations of these programmes that conclude that, at best, such conservation programmes do not harm their participants. However, we are also able to provide evidence that participation in the Mexican programme increases participants’ perception of the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services obtained from the forest. These results add more evidence to the thin literature on the behavioural dimensions of ecosystem services and the kind of responses of program participants to the conservation of those services.

AB  - The relative pressure difference across stenotic blood vessels serves as an important clinical index for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular diseases. While the clinical gold standard for relative pressure difference measurements is invasive catheterization, Phase-Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging has emerged as a promising tool for enabling a noninvasive quantification, by linking highly spatially resolved velocity measurements with relative pressures via the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we provide a review and analysis of current methods for relative pressure estimation and propose 3 additional techniques. Methods are compared using synthetic data from numerical examples, and sensitivity to subsampling and noise was explored. Through our analysis, we verify that the newly proposed approaches are more robust with respect to spatial subsampling and less sensitive to noise and therefore provide improved means for estimating relative pressure differences noninvasively.

AB  - Interactions between the land biosphere and the atmosphere play an important role for the Earth's carbon cycle and thus should be considered in studies of global carbon cycling and climate. Simple approaches are a useful first step in this direction but may not be applicable for certain climatic conditions. To improve the ability of the reduced-complexity Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model DCESS to address cold climate conditions, we reformulated the model's land biosphere module by extending it to include three dynamically varying vegetation zones as well as a permafrost component. The vegetation zones are formulated by emulating the behaviour of a complex land biosphere model. We show that with the new module, the size and timing of carbon exchanges between atmosphere and land are represented more realistically in cooling and warming experiments. In particular, we use the new module to address carbon cycling and climate change across the last glacial transition. Within the constraints provided by various proxy data records, we tune the DCESS model to a Last Glacial Maximum state and then conduct transient sensitivity experiments across the transition under the application of explicit transition functions for high-latitude ocean exchange, atmospheric dust, and the land ice sheet extent. We compare simulated time evolutions of global mean temperature, pCO2, atmospheric and oceanic carbon isotopes as well as ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations with proxy data records. In this way we estimate the importance of different processes across the transition with emphasis on the role of land biosphere variations and show that carbon outgassing from permafrost and uptake of carbon by the land biosphere broadly compensate for each other during the temperature rise of the early last deglaciation. © Author(s) 2017.

AB  - In the past two decades, much has been learned about the late Quaternary climate history of the Atacama Desert with some details still unclear about the seasonality, timing and extent of wet and dry phases. Modern climate studies reveal that, far from exhibiting a unique pattern, seasonal precipitation originates from many sources and mechanisms. For the last 16 ka, we attempt to sort out these complexities in pollen records from four fossil rodent midden series spanning 22°–25°S in northern Chile. Widespread wet conditions prevailed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, particularly between 13 and 9 ka, evidenced by <400 m lowering of pollen zones (plant communities) compared to today. Regional differences in the timing and magnitude of this displacement may be related to the prevailing source (tropical/extra-tropical) or mode (NNW/SE) of tropical precipitation through time. Wet conditions persisted well into the early Holocene, lasting ∼1–1.5 ka longer than previously suggested. The pollen record suggests extreme drying ∼8 ka, possibly associated with a northward shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, tracking minimum insolation values at subtropical latitudes during the austral summer. The establishment of conditions similar to today happened ∼4 ka.

AB  - Few studies have examined in detail the sequence of events during the last glacial termination (T1) in the core sector of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS), the largest ice mass in the Southern Hemisphere outside of Antarctica. Here we report results from Lago Edita (47°8′ S, 72°25′ W, 570 m a.s.l.), a small closed-basin lake located in a valley overridden by eastward-flowing Andean glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The Lago Edita record shows glaciolacustrine sedimentation until 19 400 yr BP, followed by organic sedimentation in a closed-basin lake and a mosaic of cold-resistant hygrophilous conifers and rainforest trees, along with alpine herbs between 19 400 and 11 000 yr BP. Our data suggest that the PIS retreated at least ∼ 90 km from its LGM limit between 21 000 and 19 400 yr BP and that scattered, low-density populations of cold-resistant hygrophilous conifers, rainforest trees, high-Andean and steppe herbs thrived east of the Andes during the LGM and T1, implying high precipitation levels and southern westerly wind (SWW) influence at 47° S. The conifer Podocarpus nubigena increased between 14 500 and 13 000 yr BP, suggesting even stronger SWW influence during the Antarctic Cold Reversal, after which it declined and persisted until 11 000 yr BP. Large increases in arboreal pollen at ∼ 13 000 and ∼ 11 000 yr BP led to the establishment of forests near Lago Edita between 10 000 and 9000 yr BP, suggesting a rise in the regional tree line along the eastern Andean slopes driven by warming pulses at ∼ 13 000 and ∼ 11 000 yr BP and a subsequent decline in SWW influence at ∼ 11 000 yr BP. We propose that the PIS imposed a regional cooling signal along its eastern, downwind margin through T1 that lasted until the separation of the northern and southern Patagonian ice fields along the Andes during the Younger Dryas period. We posit that the withdrawal of glacial and associated glaciolacustrine environments through T1 provided a route for the dispersal of hygrophilous trees and herbs from the eastern flank of the central Patagonian Andes, contributing to the afforestation of the western Andean slopes and pacific coasts of central Patagonia during T1.

AB  - We present a new coccolithophore productivity reconstruction spanning the last 300 ka in core GeoB12613-1 retrieved from the western tropical Indian Ocean (IO), an area that mainly derives its warm and oligotrophic surface waters from the eastern IO. Application of a calibrated assemblage-based productivity index indicates a reduction in estimated primary productivity (EPP) from 300 ka to the present, with reconstructed EPP values ranging from 91 to 246 g C/m2/yr. Coccolithophore assemblages and coccolith fraction Sr/Ca indicate three main phases of productivity change, with major changes at 160 and 46 ka. The productivity and water-column stratification records show both dominant precession and obliquity periodicities, which appear to control the paleoproductivity in the study area over the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. Shallowing of the thermocline due to strengthening of the trade winds in response to insolation maxima resulted to peaks in EPP. Comparison with the eastern IO productivity and stratification coccolithophore data reveals good correspondence with our records, indicating a strong tropical Pacific influence in our study area. Both of these records show high productivity from 300 to 160 ka, interpreted to be due to stronger Walker Circulation while the declining productivity from 160 ka to the present day is a consequence of its weakening intensity.

AB  - Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 °C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5 %, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10 % at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6 % decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22 %. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajós is reduced by 31 % in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34 % over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27 % in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajós. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.

AB  - Internodal archaeological evidence of extractive occupations is presented in this study. Evidence comes from the survey and analyses of sites on the prehistoric route between Quillagua (inferior Loa River) and the north Coast of Tocopilla, across the Coastal mountain range of the Atacama Desert. This archaeological record is discussed in relation to previouslyknown prehistoric data about settlements and internodal trails of the Coast, and Inferior and middle Loa sections. We characterize two extractive sites of mineral resources detected in association to pathways, a mine and a lithic workshop. Data from excavations, analyses of archaeological materials and absolute dates are used to discuss mobility of coastal groups to the interior of the desert and of Oasis's societies to the coast in different periods of time. Previously formulated models of mobility and provisioning, as well as regional archaeological and ethnographic data, are used to discuss the presented results, and are applied to examine more general aspects of "Internodal Studies".

AU  - Shaffer, Gary

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Mineral dust aerosols cool Earth directly by scattering incoming solar radiation and indirectly by affecting clouds and biogeochemical cycles. Recent Earth history has featured quasi-100,000-y, glacial−interglacial climate cycles with lower/higher temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations during glacials/interglacials. Global average, glacial maxima dust levels were more than 3 times higher than during interglacials, thereby contributing to glacial cooling. However, the timing, strength, and overall role of dust−climate feedbacks over these cycles remain unclear. Here we use dust deposition data and temperature reconstructions from ice sheet, ocean sediment, and land archives to construct dust−climate relationships. Although absolute dust deposition rates vary greatly among these archives, they all exhibit striking, nonlinear increases toward coldest glacial conditions. From these relationships and reconstructed temperature time series, we diagnose glacial−interglacial time series of dust radiative forcing and iron fertilization of ocean biota, and use these time series to force Earth system model simulations. The results of these simulations show that dust−climate feedbacks, perhaps set off by orbital forcing, push the system in and out of extreme cold conditions such as glacial maxima. Without these dust effects, glacial temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations would have been much more stable at higher, intermediate glacial levels. The structure of residual anomalies over the glacial−interglacial climate cycles after subtraction of dust effects provides constraints for the strength and timing of other processes governing these cycles.

TI  - A human-scale perspective on global warming: Zero emission year and personal quotes
AU  - de la Fuente, A.

T2  - PloS one
AB  - This article builds on the premise that human consumption of goods, food and transport are the ultimate drivers of climate change. However, the nature of the climate change problem (well described as a tragedy of the commons) makes it difficult for individuals to recognise their personal duty to implement behavioural changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, this article aims to analyse the climate change issue from a human-scale perspective, in which each of us has a clearly defined personal quota of CO2 emissions that limits our activity and there is a finite time during which CO2  emissions must be eliminated to achieve the “well below 2 °C” warming limit set by the Paris Agreement of 2015 (COP21). Thus, this work’s primary contribution is to connect an  equal per capita fairness approach to a global carbon budget, linking personal levels with planetary levels. Here, we show that a personal quota of 5.0 tons of CO 2 yr -1 p -1 is a representative value for both past and future emissions; for this level of a constant per capita emissions and without considering any mitigation, the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2030 and 2050, respectively. These are references years that provide an order of magnitude of the time that is left to reverse the global warming trend. More realistic scenarios that consider a smooth transition toward a zero-emission world show that the global accumulated emissions compatible with the “well below 2 °C” and 2 °C targets will be exhausted by 2040 and 2080, respectively. Implications of this paper include a return to personal responsibility following equity principles among individuals, and a definition of boundaries to the personal emissions of CO2 .

AB  - The Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) are the surface expression of geostrophic winds that encircle the southern mid-latitudes. In conjunction with the Southern Ocean, they establish a coupled system that not only controls climate in the southern third of the world, but is also closely connected to the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and CO2 degassing from the deep ocean. Paradoxically, little is known about their behavior since the last ice age and relationships with mid-latitude glacier history and tropical climate variability. Here we present a lake sediment record from Chilean Patagonia (51°S) that reveals fluctuations of the low-level SWW at mid-latitudes, including strong westerlies during the Antarctic Cold Reversal, anomalously low intensity during the early Holocene, which was unfavorable for glacier growth, and strong SWW since ∼7.5 ka. We detect nine positive Southern Annular Mode-like events at centennial timescale since ∼5.8 ka that alternate with cold/wet intervals favorable for glacier expansions (Neoglaciations) in southern Patagonia. The correspondence of key features of mid-latitude atmospheric circulation with shifts in tropical climate since ∼10 ka suggests that coherent climatic shifts in these regions have driven climate change in vast sectors of the Southern Hemisphere at centennial and millennial timescales.

AB  - Mineral dust is the major continental contributor to the global atmospheric aerosol burden with important effects on the climate system. Regionally, a large fraction of the emitted dust is produced in North Africa, however the total emission flux from this region is still highly uncertain. In order to reduce these uncertainties, emission estimates through top-down approaches (i.e., usually models constrained by observations) had been successfully developed and implemented. Such studies usually rely on a single observational dataset and propagate the possible observational errors of this dataset onto the emission estimates. In this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five different satellites are assimilated one by one in a source inversion system to estimate dust emission fluxes over northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. We estimate mineral dust emissions for the year 2006 and discuss the impact of the assimilated dataset on the analysis. We find a relatively large dispersion in flux estimates among the five experiments, which can likely be attributed to differences in the assimilated observation datasets and their associated error statistics. We also show how the assimilation of a variety of AOD products can help to identify systematic errors in models.

T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - The recent catastrophic wildfires in Portugal and Chile shared similar features, not just because they developed under extreme weather conditions but also because extensive forest plantations were involved. Dense forest plantations of flammable pine and eucalypt species favor the development of high-intensity large fires, threatening people and the forest industry sustainability under increasingly frequent and severe drought events. Preventive land-use planning and cost-effective fuel management are key elements of sustainable forestry. Understanding the fire ecology context prior to plantation establishment is also crucial for the success of fire management planning. Although the forest industry has contributed to the economy of these countries, improved regulation and science-based management policies are strongly needed. Fuel treatment strategies can be optimized by risk-based modeling approaches, and should be mandatory in wildland-urban interfaces. The tragedy caused by these wildfires is an opportunity to change towards more sustainable landscape arrangements that reconcile ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and protection from life-threatening wildfires.

AB  - The knowledge of surface ozone mole fractions and their global distribution is of utmost importance due to the impact of ozone on human health and ecosystems and the central role of ozone in controlling the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. The availability of long-term ozone records is far better in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, and recent analyses of the seven accessible records in the Southern Hemisphere have shown inconclusive trends. Since late 1995, surface ozone is measured in situ at "El Tololo", a high-altitude (2200 m a.s.l.) and pristine station in Chile (30° S, 71° W). The dataset has been recently fully quality controlled and reprocessed. This study presents the observed ozone trends and annual cycles and identifies key processes driving these patterns. From 1995 to 2010, an overall positive trend of  ∼  0.7 ppb decade−1 is found. Strongest trends per season are observed in March and April. Highest mole fractions are observed in late spring (October) and show a strong correlation with ozone transported from the stratosphere down into the troposphere, as simulated with a model. Over the 20 years of observations, the springtime ozone maximum has shifted to earlier times in the year, which, again, is strongly correlated with a temporal shift in the occurrence of the maximum of simulated stratospheric ozone transport at the site. We conclude that background ozone at El Tololo is mainly driven by stratospheric intrusions rather than photochemical production from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. The major footprint of the sampled air masses is located over the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, due to the negligible influence of local processes, the ozone record also allows studying the influence of El Niño and La Niña episodes on background ozone levels in South America. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, during La Niña conditions, ozone mole fractions reach higher levels than during El Niño conditions.

AB  - Geological records reveal a number of ancient, large and rapid negative excursions of the carbon-13 isotope. Such excursions can only be explained by massive injections of depleted carbon to the Earth system over a short duration. These injections may have forced strong global warming events, sometimes accompanied by mass extinctions such as the Triassic-Jurassic and end-Permian extinctions 201 and 252 million years ago, respectively. In many cases, evidence points to methane as the dominant form of injected carbon, whether as thermogenic methane formed by magma intrusions through overlying carbon-rich sediment or from warming-induced dissociation of methane hydrate, a solid compound of methane and water found in ocean sediments. As a consequence of the ubiquity and importance of methane in major Earth events, Earth system models for addressing such events should include a comprehensive treatment of methane cycling but such a treatment has often been lacking. Here we implement methane cycling in the Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) model, a simplified but well-tested Earth system model of intermediate complexity. We use a generic methane input function that allows variation in input type, size, timescale and ocean–atmosphere partition. To be able to treat such massive inputs more correctly, we extend the model to deal with ocean suboxic/anoxic conditions and with radiative forcing and methane lifetimes appropriate for high atmospheric methane concentrations. With this new model version, we carried out an extensive set of simulations for methane inputs of various sizes, timescales and ocean–atmosphere partitions to probe model behavior. We find that larger methane inputs over shorter timescales with more methane dissolving in the ocean lead to ever-increasing ocean anoxia with consequences for ocean life and global carbon cycling. Greater methane input directly to the atmosphere leads to more warming and, for example, greater carbon dioxide release from land soils. Analysis of synthetic sediment cores from the simulations provides guidelines for the interpretation of real sediment cores spanning the warming events. With this improved DCESS model version and paleo-reconstructions, we are now better armed to gauge the amounts, types, timescales and locations of methane injections driving specific, observed deep-time, global warming events.

AB  - In the Mediterranean Andes (MA; 30°S–37°S), the main rivers are largely fed by melting snowpack and provide fresh water to around 10 million people on both sides of the Cordillera. Water resources in the MA are under pressure due to the extensive development of industrial agriculture and mining activities. This pressure is increasing as the region faces one of its worst recorded droughts. Previous studies have pointed to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the main climatic force impacting the MA. However, the role of decadal and multidecadal climate variability, their spatial patterns and the recurrence of long-term droughts, remains poorly studied. In this contribution to a better understanding of these factors, spatial and temporal patterns of hydroclimatic variability are analyzed using an extensive database of streamflow, precipitation, and snowpack covering the period between 1910 – 2011. These analyses are based on the combination of correlation, principal components and kernel-estimation techniques. Despite a general common pattern across the MA region, our results identify two hydroclimatic sub-regions, located north and south of 34°S. While the interannual variability associated with ENSO is slightly stronger north of 34°S, the variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and/or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation index (IPO) shows similar patterns in both regions. However, variations produced by the IPO forcing seem to be greater in the southern sub-region since 1975. Our estimations on drought recurrence reveal a generalized increase in dry extremes since the 1950’s. These findings suggest that the northern MA are more vulnerable to changes in hydrology and climate than the southern MA.

AB  - Temuco is a mid-size city representative of severe wood smoke pollution in southern Chile; however, little is known about the indoor air quality in this region. A field measurement campaign at 63 households in the Temuco urban area was conducted in winter 2014 and is reported here. In this study, indoor and outdoor (24-hr) PM2.5 and its elemental composition were measured and compared. Infiltration parameters and outdoor/indoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 were also determined. A statistical evaluation of how various air quality interventions and household features influence indoor PM2.5 was also performed. This study determined median indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations of 44.4 and 41.8 μg/m3, respectively. An average infiltration factor (0.62 ± 0.06) was estimated using sulfur as a tracer species. Using a simple mass balance approach, median indoor and outdoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 concentrations were then estimated as 12.5 and 26.5 μg/m3, respectively; therefore, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from outdoor infiltration. This high percentage is due to high outdoor pollution and relatively high household air exchange rates (median: 1.06 h−1). This study found that S, Br and Rb were dominated by outdoor contributions, while Si, Ca, Ti, Fe and As originated from indoor sources. Using continuous indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements, a median indoor source strength of 75 μg PM2.5/min was estimated for the diurnal period, similar to literature results. For the evening period, the median estimate rose to 135 μg PM2.5/min, reflecting a more intense wood burning associated to cooking and space heating at night. Statistical test results (at the 90% confidence level) support the ongoing woodstove replacement program (reducing emissions) and household weatherization subsidies (reducing heating demand) for improving indoor air quality in southern Chile, and suggest that a cookstove improvement program might be helpful as well. In the city of Temuco, southern Chile, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from severe outdoor pollution due to intensive wood burning, enhanced by poor household building standards and fuel poverty.

AB  - Emission data is an essential tool for understanding environmental problems associated with sources and dynamics of air pollutants in urban environments, especially those emitted from vehicular sources. There is a lack of knowledge about the estimation of air pollutant emissions and particularly its spatial and temporal distribution in South America, mainly in medium-sized cities with population less than one million inhabitants. This work performed the spatial and temporal disaggregation of the on-road vehicle emission inventory (EI) in the medium-sized Andean city of Manizales, Colombia, with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h. A reported top-down methodology, based on the analysis of traffic flow levels and road network distribution, was applied. Results obtained allowed the identification of several hotspots of emission at the downtown zone and the residential and commercial area of Manizales. Downtown exhibited the highest percentage contribution of emissions normalized by its total area, with values equal to 6% and 5% of total CO and PM10 emissions per km2 respectively. These indexes were higher than those obtained in residential-commercial area with values of 2%/km2 for both pollutants. Temporal distribution showed strong relationship with driving patterns at rush hours, as well as an important influence of passenger cars and motorcycles in emissions of CO both at downtown and residential-commercial areas, and the impact of public transport in PM10 emissions in the residential-commercial zone. Considering that detailed information about traffic counts and road network distribution is not always available in medium-sized cities, this work compares other simplified top-down methods for spatially assessing the on-road vehicle EI. Results suggested that simplified methods could underestimate the spatial allocation of downtown emissions, a zone dominated by high traffic of vehicles. The comparison between simplified methods based on total traffic counts and road density distribution suggested that the use of total traffic counts in a simplified form could enhance higher uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation of emissions. Results obtained could add new information that help to improve the air pollution management system in the city and contribute to local public policy decisions. Additionally, this work provides appropriate resolution emission fluxes for ongoing research in atmospheric modeling in the city, with the aim to improve the understanding of transport, transformation and impacts of pollutant emissions in urban air quality.

AB  - Archaeological sites composed only of surficial lithics are widespread in arid environments. Numerical dating of such sites is challenging, however, and even establishing a relative chronology can be daunting. One potentially helpful method for assigning relative chronologies is to use lithic weathering, on the assumption that the most weathered artifacts are also the oldest. Yet, few studies have systematically assessed how local environmental processes affect weathering of surficial lithics. Using macroscopic analyses, we compared the weathering of surficial lithic assemblages from seven mid-to-late Holocene archaeological sites sampled from four different microenvironments in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Changes in polish, texture, shine, and color were used to establish significant differences in weathering between two kinds of locations: interfluves and canyon sites. Lithics from interfluve sites were moderately to highly weathered by wind and possessed a dark coating, whereas canyon lithics were mildly weathered despite greater exposure to moisture, often lacked indications of eolian abrasion, and lacked dark coatings. Our results show that lithic weathering can be used as a proxy for relative age, but only after considering local environmental factors. The power of such chronologies can be improved by combining archaeological, paleoenvironmental, geomorphological, and taphonomic data.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences
AB  - Vegetation diversity and interaction is thought to have a beneficial effect on ecosystem functioning, particularly improving ecosystem resistance to drought. This is of significant importance in the context of a warmer world, as extreme events such as droughts become more likely. Most of the studies performed so far on vegetation interaction are based on observations. Here we use the land surface model JULES to study the potential of vegetation mixing to mitigate the negative effect of drought events on the land surface through interaction, a mechanism which is difficult to study in situ at large scales. Using a set of simulations with mixed and unmixed vegetation, we show that the carbon, water, and energy fluxes are significantly affected by vegetation competition for water resources. The interaction is in general beneficial for the ecosystem carbon assimilation due to a better use of water resources. This benefit is highest when traits between vegetation types concerning resource competition overlap least. For a tree-grass combination, mixing improves carbon assimilation by 5% to 8% during summer. The NPP benefit of mixing increases further under progressively more resource-limited conditions up to an inflection point with a benefit of 14%, after which it falls back to zero under extremely dry conditions. Mixing also tends to reduce the inter-annual variability of the ecosystem carbon sink and therefore improves the resistance of the ecosystem. Our results highlight the importance of vegetation interaction in climate simulations and impact studies, and the potential of vegetation mixing as a mitigation tool.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres
AB  - The orographic effect of the Andes (30°S–55°S) on upwind precipitating clouds from midlatitude frontal systems is investigated using surface and satellite data. Rain gauges between 33°S and 44°S indicate that annual precipitation increases from the Pacific coast to the windward slopes by a factor of 1.8 ± 0.3. Hourly gauges and instantaneous satellite estimates reveal that the cross-barrier increase in annual precipitation responds to an increase in both the intensity and frequency of precipitation. CloudSat satellite data indicate that orographic effects of the Andes on precipitating ice clouds increase gradually from midlatitudes to subtropics, likely as a result of a reduction of synoptic forcing and an increase of the height of the Andes equatorward. To the south of 40°S, the thickness of clouds slightly decreases from offshore to the Andes. The total ice content increases substantially from the open ocean to the coastal zone (except to the south of 50°S, where there is no much variation over the ocean), and then experience little changes in the cross-mountain direction over the upstream and upslope sectors. Nevertheless, the maximum ice content over the upslope sector is larger and occurs at a lower level than their upwind counterparts. In the subtropics, the offshore clouds contain almost no ice, but the total and maximum ice content significantly increases toward the Andes, with values being much larger than their counterparts over the extratropical Andes. Further, the largest amounts of cloud ice are observed upstream of the tallest Andes, suggesting that upstream blocking dominates there.

AB  - Second-growth forests represent the greatest potential resource for forest management and large-scale ecological restoration in many regions. In south-central Chile, second-growth forests include those dominated by Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , Drimys winteri , and a mixture of evergreen species, especially hardwoods. This article examines the influence of fire and logging on the establishment patterns and development of second-growth forests in south-central Chile. We characterize the size structure and composition of these four types of forests with sampling plots. The identification of the type of disturbance and its date of occurrence was determined from evidence such as fire scars and even-aged pulses of tree establishment. The size, structure and species composition of these forests indicate an intermediate state of development with an average density and basal area ranging from 1294 to 5038 trees ha -1 and from 59 to 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectively. Logging and/or devastating fires that occurred in the early decades of the 1900s promoted the relatively rapid establishment and growth of pioneer species ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). In the Mixed Evergreen second-growth forests, mid-shade or shade tolerant species (e.g., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia, Amomyrtus luma, and A. meli ) became established mostly through vegetative sprouting. Fires and logging have been pervasive factors in determining the structural and compositional uniformity of the native forests of south-central Chile. Ecological restoration at a landscape level, either by ecological processes (i.e., a reduction in fire frequency) and/or the structure and composition of second-growth forests, provide a relevant approach to accelerating the generation of attributes of old-growth forests, therefore meeting manifold societal demands for forest goods and services. Los bosques secundarios representan el mayor recurso forestal para el manejo y la restauración de gran escala en muchas regiones del mundo. En el centro-sur de Chile los bosques secundarios están dominados por Nothofagus obliqua , N. dombeyi , D. winteri , y Siempreverde mixtos. El presente artículo examina la influencia del fuego y tala en los patrones de establecimiento y desarrollo de bosques secundarios de la región centro-sur de Chile. Para la caracterización de la estructura y composición de cada bosque secundario se seleccionaron rodales representativos estableciendo 4-6 parcelas de 900 m 2 . El tipo de disturbio y su fecha de ocurrencia fue establecido a través de evidencias tales como cicatrices de fuego y pulsos de establecimiento de árboles. La estructura de tamaños y composición indican un estado de desarrollo intermedio o de reiniciación del sotobosque presentando en promedio una densidad y área basal que varía entre 1294 y 5038 árboles ha -1 y entre 59 y 85 m 2 ha -1 , respectivamente. Incendios de gran severidad y/o madereo ocurridos en las primeras décadas de los 1900 promovieron un rápido establecimiento de las principales especies pioneras ( Nothofagus obliqua, N. dombeyi, D. winteri ). En los bosques secundarios Siempreverde mixtos, el establecimiento de especies tolerantes o semi-tolerantes a la sombra (ej., Gevuina avellana, Eucryphia cordifolia ), fue principalmente por rebrotes vegetativos. El fuego y madereo han sido agentes clave en determinar la uniformidad estructural y composicional de los bosques nativos del centro-sur de Chile. La restauración ecológica a escala de paisaje, tanto de procesos ecológicos (frecuencia incendios) como de la estructura y composición de los bosques secundarios, ofrece una relevante aproximación para acelerar la generación de atributos de bosques antiguos que satisfagan los múltiples bienes y servicios ecosistémicos demandados por la sociedad.

AB  - Despite the importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the global radiative balance and atmospheric ozone chemistry, its sources and sinks within the Earth's system are still poorly understood. In the ocean, N2O is produced by microbiological processes such as nitrification and partial denitrification, which account for about a third of global emissions. Conversely, complete denitrification (the dissimilative reduction of N2O to N2) under suboxic/anoxic conditions is the only known pathway accountable for N2O consumption in the ocean. In this work, it is demonstrated that the biological assimilation of N2O could be a significant pathway capable of directly transforming this gas into particulate organic nitrogen (PON). N2O is shown to be biologically fixed within the subtropical and tropical waters of the eastern South Pacific Ocean, under a wide range of oceanographic conditions and at rates ranging from 2 pmol N L(-1) d(-) to 14.8 nmol N L(-1) d(-1) (mean ± SE of 0.522 ± 1.06 nmol N L(-1) d(-1), n = 93). Additional assays revealed that cultured cyanobacterial strains of Trichodesmium (H-9 and IMS 101), and Crocosphaera (W-8501) have the capacity to directly fix N2O under laboratory conditions; suggesting that marine photoautotrophic diazotrophs could be using N2O as a substrate. This metabolic capacity however was absent in Synechococcus (RCC 1029). The findings presented here indicate that assimilative N2O fixation takes place under extreme environmental conditions (i.e., light, nutrient, oxygen) where both autotrophic (including cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic microbes appear to be involved. This process could provide a globally significant sink for atmospheric N2O which in turn affects the oceanic N2O inventory and may also represent a yet unexplored global oceanic source of fixed N.

AB  - Although N<inf>2</inf> fixation could represent a supplementary source of bioavailable nitrogen in coastal upwelling areas and underlying oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), the limited data available prevent assessing its variability and biogeochemical significance. Here we report the most extensive N<inf>2</inf> fixation data set gathered to date in the upwelling area off central Chile (36°S). It covers interannual to high frequency time scales in an area of about 82,500 km<sup>2</sup> in the eastern South Pacific (ESP). Because heterotrophic N<inf>2</inf> fixation may be regulated by DOM availability in the ESP, we conducted experiments at different oxygen conditions and included DOM amendments in order to test diazotrophic activity. Rates in the euphotic zone showed strong temporal variability which resulted in values reaching 0.5 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in 2006 (average 0.32 ± 0.17 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and up to 126.8 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (average 24.75 ± 37.9 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) in 2011. N<inf>2</inf> fixation in subsurface suboxic conditions (1.5 ± 1.16 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) also occurred mainly during late summer and autumn while virtually absent in winter. The diversity of diazotrophs was dominated by heterotrophs, with higher richness in surface compared to OMZ waters. Rates in oxygen depleted conditions could exceed values obtained in the euphotic layer, but rates were not dependent on the availability of dissolved organic matter. N<inf>2</inf> fixation also showed a positive correlation with total chlorophyll and the C:N ratio of phytoplankton, but not to the P excess compared to N. We conclude that the diazotrophic community responds to the composition of phytoplankton rather than the extent of N deficiency and the availability of bulk DOM in this system. Key Points: The largest N<inf>2</inf> fixation data set for the Eastern South Pacific is presented N<inf>2</inf> fixation activity decreases from coast to open ocean N<inf>2</inf> fixation is likely to be dominated by heterotrophic bacterioplankton

TI  - Formulation, calibration and validation of the DAIS model (version 1), a simple Antarctic ice sheet model sensitive to variations of sea level and ocean subsurface temperature
AU  - Shaffer, G.
T2  - Geoscientific Model Development
AB  - The DCESS (Danish Center for Earth System Science) Antarctic Ice Sheet (DAIS) model is presented. Model hindcasts of Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) sea level equivalent are forced by reconstructed Antarctic temperatures, global mean sea level and high-latitude, ocean subsurface temperatures, the latter calculated using the DCESS model forced by reconstructed global mean atmospheric temperatures. The model is calibrated by comparing such hindcasts for different model configurations with paleoreconstructions of AIS sea level equivalent from the last interglacial, the last glacial maximum and the mid-Holocene. The calibrated model is then validated against present estimates of the rate of AIS ice loss. It is found that a high-order dependency of ice flow at the grounding line on water depth there is needed to capture the observed response of the AIS at ice age terminations. Furthermore, it is found that a dependency of this ice flow on ocean subsurface temperature by way of ice shelf demise and a resulting buttressing decrease is needed to explain the contribution of the AIS to global mean sea level rise at the last interglacial. When forced and calibrated in this way, model hindcasts of the rate of present-day AIS ice loss agree with recent, data-based estimates of this ice loss rate. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Plant growth at extremely high elevations is constrained by high daily thermal amplitude, strong solar radiation, and water scarcity. These conditions are particularly harsh in the tropics, where the highest elevation treelines occur. In this environment the maintenance of a positive carbon balance involves protecting the photosynthetic apparatus and taking advantage of any climatically favorable periods. To characterize photoprotective mechanisms at such high elevations, and particularly to address the question of whether these mechanisms are the same as those previously described in woody plants along extratropical treelines, we have studied photosynthetic responses in Polylepis tarapacana in the central Andes (18 °S) along an elevational gradient from 4,300 to 4,900 m. For comparative purposes this gradient has been complemented with a lower elevation site (3,700 m) where another Polylepis species (P. rugulosa) occurs. During the daily cycle, two periods of photosynthetic activity were observed: one during the morning when, despite low temperatures, assimilation was high; and the second starting at noon when the stomata closed because of a rise in the vapor pressure deficit and thermal dissipation is prevalent over photosynthesis. From dawn to noon there was a decrease in the content of antenna pigments (chlorophyll b and neoxanthin), together with an increase in the content of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. These results could be caused by a reduction in the antenna size along with an increase in photo-protection. Additionally, photo-protection was enhanced by a partial overnight retention of de-epoxised xanthophylls. The unique combination of all of these mechanisms made possible the efficient use of the favorable conditions during the morning while still providing enough protection for the rest of the day. This strategy differs completely from that of extratropical mountain trees, which uncouple light-harvesting and energy-use during long periods of unfavorable, winter conditions.

AB  - Projected future trends in water availability are associated with large uncertainties in many regions of the globe. In mountain areas with complex topography, climate models have often limited capabilities to adequately simulate the precipitation variability on small spatial scales. Also, their validation is hampered by typically very low station density. In the Central Andes of South America, a semi-arid high-mountain region with strong seasonality, zonal wind in the upper troposphere is a good proxy for interannual precipitation variability. Here, we combine instrumental measurements, reanalysis and paleoclimate data, and a 57-member ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations to assess changes in Central Andes precipitation over the period AD 1000–2100. This new database allows us to put future projections of precipitation into a previously missing multi-centennial and pre-industrial context. Our results confirm the relationship between regional summer precipitation and 200 hPa zonal wind in the Central Andes, with stronger Westerly winds leading to decreased precipitation. The period of instrumental coverage (1965–2010) is slightly dryer compared to pre-industrial times as represented by control simulations, simulations from the past Millennium, ice core data from Quelccaya ice cap and a tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction. The model ensemble identifies a clear reduction in precipitation already in the early 21st century: the 10 year running mean model uncertainty range (ensemble 16–84% spread) is continuously above the pre-industrial mean after AD 2023 (AD 2028) until the end of the 21st century in the RCP2.6 (RCP8.5) emission scenario. Average precipitation over AD 2071–2100 is outside the range of natural pre-industrial variability in 47 of the 57 model simulations for both emission scenarios. The ensemble median fraction of dry years (defined by the 5th percentile in pre-industrial conditions) is projected to increase by a factor of 4 until 2071–2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Even under the strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions projected by the RCP2.6 scenario, the Central Andes will experience a reduction in precipitation outside pre-industrial natural variability. This is of concern for the Central Andes, because society and economy are highly vulnerable to changes in the hydrological cycle and already have to face decreases in fresh water availability caused by glacier retreat.

AB  - Future global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will depend on climate feedbacks, the effect of which is expressed by climate sensitivity, the warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content. It is not clear how feedbacks, sensitivity, and temperature will evolve in our warming world, but past warming events may provide insight. Here we employ paleoreconstructions and new climate-carbon model simulations in a novel framework to explore a wide scenario range for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) carbon release and global warming event 55.8 Ma ago, a possible future warming analogue. We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.3–5.6 to 3.7–6.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM. When taken together with Last Glacial Maximum and modern estimates, this result indicates climate sensitivity increase with global warming.

T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - The climatology of wind waves over the Southeast Pacific is analysed using a 32-year hindcast from the WaveWatch III model, complemented by satellite-derived significant wave height (SWH) and buoy measurements for validation. Using partitioned spectral data, a regional climatology of wind sea and swell parameters was constructed. In general, the simulated SWH shows a good agreement with satellite and in situ SWH measurements, although the model appears to have a spatially uniform bias of approximately 0.3 m. The spatial pattern of SWH is clearly influenced by the meridional variation of mean surface wind speed, where the stronger winds over the Southern Ocean play a significant role generating higher waves at higher latitudes. Nevertheless, regional features are observed in the annual variability of SWH, which are associated with the existence of atmospheric coastal low-level jets off the coast of Peru and central Chile. In particular, the seasonal variation of these synoptic scale jets shows a direct relationship with the annual variability of SWH and with the probability of occurrence of wind sea conditions. Off the coast of Peru at approximately 15 ∘ S the coastal low-level jet is strongest during austral winter, increasing the wind sea SWH. In contrast, off central Chile, there is an important increase of wind sea SWH during summer.  The seasonal variation of the wind sea component leads to a contrasting seasonal variation of the total SWH at these locations: off Peru the coastal jet amplifies the annual variability of SWH, while off Central Chile the annual variability of SWH is suppressed by the presence of the coastal jet. Although the general conclusions of this research are considered to be robust, we discuss the limitations of the spectral partitioning method used to distinguish wind sea and swell-sea states.

T2  - Climate Dynamics
AB  - Our observational analysis shows that the wet seasons of the American monsoon systems have shortened since 1978 due to correlated earlier retreats of the North American monsoon (NAM) and late onsets of the southern Amazon wet season, an important part of the South American monsoon (SAM). These changes are related to the combination of the global sea surface temperature (SST) warming mode, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the westward shift of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), and the enhancement of Pacific South American and Pacific North American wave train patterns, which induces variations of the regional circulation at interannual and decadal scales. The joint contributions from these forcing factors are associated with a stronger and more equatorward regional Hadley cell, which enhances convergence towards the equator, strengthening and possibly delaying the retreat of the tropical part of the NAM. This in turn accelerates the demise of the northern NAM and delays the reversal of the cross-equatorial flow over South America, reducing moisture transport to the SAM and delaying its onset. In addition, the thermodynamic response to warming appears to cause local drier land conditions over both regions, reinforcing the observed changes in these monsoons. Although previous studies have identified the isolated influence of the regional Hadley cell, ENSO, AMO, global SST warming, and NASH on the NAM, the correlated changes between NAM and SAM through variations of the cross-equatorial flow had not been established before.

TI  - The Oldest, Slowest Rainforests in the World? Massive Biomass and Slow Carbon Dynamics of Fitzroya cupressoides Temperate Forests in Southern Chile

AB  - Old-growth temperate rainforests are, per unit area, the largest and most long-lived stores of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere, but their carbon dynamics have rarely been described. The endangered Fitzroya cupressoides forests of southern South America include stands that are probably the oldest dense forest stands in the world, with long-lived trees and high standing biomass. We assess and compare aboveground biomass, and provide the first estimates of net primary productivity (NPP), carbon allocation and mean wood residence time in medium-age stands in the Alerce Costero National Park (AC) in the Coastal Range and in old-growth forests in the Alerce Andino National Park (AA) in the Andean Cordillera. Aboveground live biomass was 113-114 Mg C ha(-1) and 448-517 Mg C ha(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Aboveground productivity was 3.35-3.36 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and 2.22-2.54 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AA, values generally lower than others reported for temperate wet forests worldwide, mainly due to the low woody growth of Fitzroya. NPP was 4.21-4.24 and 3.78-4.10 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in AC and AA, respectively. Estimated mean wood residence time was a minimum of 539-640 years for the whole forest in the Andes and 1368-1393 years for only Fitzroya in this site. Our biomass estimates for the Andes place these ecosystems among the most massive forests in the world. Differences in biomass production between sites seem mostly apparent as differences in allocation rather than productivity. Residence time estimates for Fitzroya are the highest reported for any species and carbon dynamics in these forests are the slowest reported for wet forests worldwide. Although primary productivity is low in Fitzroya forests, they probably act as ongoing biomass carbon sinks on long-term timescales due to their low mortality rates and exceptionally long residence times that allow biomass to be accumulated for millennia.

AB  - The soil carbon dynamics of southern hemisphere temperate rainforests have rarely been studied. Here, we report for the first time soil CO2 effluxes and their partitioning for medium-age and old-growth Fitzroya cupressoides forests growing under contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal Range and Andean Cordillera of southern Chile. Fitzroya is a high biomass and one of the longest lived species in the world. We characterized soil respiration patterns over almost 2 yr. Annual soil respiration was slightly higher in younger forests from the Coastal Range compared with Andean forests during the first studied year (6.37–6.66 vs. 5.06–6.14 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), and significantly higher during the second year mainly due to a warmer and drier summer (8.08–8.64 vs. 4.98–5.35 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1). Therefore, warmer and drier conditions, likely to become more common in this region under future climate change, were associated with significantly higher respiration in the shallow soils of the coast, but not in the Andes. A higher proportion of autotrophic respiration was found in the Coastal Range forest probably due to a much higher fine root biomass in this site. However, fine root productivity, an important contributor of belowground carbon fluxes, was a little lower (not significantly) in the coastal site (0.81 ± 0.60 vs. 1.50 ± 0.42 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1), indicating a longer root residence time in forests from this area. Soil CO2 effluxes from these forests and their root productivity are at the lower end of values recorded for other mature and old-growth temperate wet forests worldwide. The intrinsic longevity and the particularly poor soils and rainy conditions where these forests grow may influence these facts. Interannual climate variability appears to be especially important for soil respiration in the Coastal Range due to the more Mediterranean climate influence and shallow, poor water retention soils in this area.

AB  - This study aimed at understanding the natural recovery of the evergreen forest a decade after being affected by clearcutting and burning, in a site located in the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (39°56’ S-73°40’ W). A total of 27 circular (50.2 m2) plots with eight subplots each were established. Floristic composition was recorded and quantitative, diametric and age structures were determined. The results show a richness of 77 vascular species (84.4% natives), with Lophosoria quadripinnata presenting the highest relative cover (20.7%). The presence of hemicryptophytes (35%) indicates human intervention in the place. Trees were the main form of growth, being Drimys winteri, Saxegothaea conspicua and Amomyrtus luma the species with higher plant density. The latter two species growing under Chusquea macrostachya and Lophosoria quadripinnata cover. Drimys winteri and Embothrium coccineum were established immediately after the anthropogenic disturbance of clearcutting and burning, confirming the pioneering character of these two species after highly severe disturbances. Regeneration of Nothofagus nitida was scarce in the area, probably associated with low availability and seed dispersal capacity from surrounding forests. Understanding the early response of evergreen forests affected by anthropogenic disturbance is very important for assisting and guiding the ecological restoration of these forest ecosystems.

AB  - This paper summarizes the results of an intercomparison project with Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) undertaken in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The focus is on long-term climate projections designed to 1) quantify the climate change commitment of different radiative forcing trajectories and 2) explore the extent to which climate change is reversible on human time scales. All commitment simulations follow the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and their extensions to year 2300. Most EMICs simulate substantial surface air temperature and thermosteric sea level rise commitment following stabilization of the atmospheric composition at year-2300 levels. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is weakened temporarily and recovers to near-preindustrial values in most models for RCPs 2.6–6.0. The MOC weakening is more persistent for RCP8.5. Elimination of anthropogenic CO2 emissions after 2300 results in slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. At year 3000 atmospheric CO2 is still at more than half its year-2300 level in all EMICs for RCPs 4.5–8.5. Surface air temperature remains constant or decreases slightly and thermosteric sea level rise continues for centuries after elimination of CO2 emissions in all EMICs. Restoration of atmospheric CO2 from RCP to preindustrial levels over 100–1000 years requires large artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and does not result in the simultaneous return to preindustrial climate conditions, as surface air temperature and sea level response exhibit a substantial time lag relative to atmospheric CO2.

T2  - Climate Research
AB  - The hydrological discharge (HD) model of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology is forced by a variety of climate model datasets to investigate the future of discharge in the Euphrates-Tigris Basin. The data include daily time series of surface runoff and sub-surface runoff outputs of 2 global climate models (GCMs) (the SRES A1B scenario simulation of ECHAM5/MPIOM and the RCP 4.5 scenario simulation of MPI-ESM-LR) and the dynamically downscaled outputs of ECHAM5/MPIOM and NCAR-CCSM3 scenario (SRES A1FI, A2 and B1) simulations. The suite of simulations enables a comprehensive analysis of the projected river discharge, and allows a comparison between CMIP5 simulations of MPI-ESM-LR and CMIP3 results from its predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM on a basin scale. We demonstrate that HD simulations forced with relatively low-resolution GCM outputs are not good at reproducing the seasonal cycle of discharge, which is typically characterized by less flow in the peak season and an earlier peak in annual discharge. Simulations forced with the MPI-ESM-LR yield more robust information on the annual cycle and timing of the annual peak discharge than ECHAM5-forced simulations. In contrast to GCM-forced simulations, high-resolution RCM-forced simulations reproduce the annual cycle of discharge reasonably well; however, overestimation of discharge during the cold season and bias in the timing of springtime snowmelt peaks persist in the RCM-forced simulations. Different RCM-forced scenario simulations indicate substantial decreases in mean annual discharge for the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers by the end of the century, ranging from 19-58%. Significant temporal shifts to earlier days (3-5 wk by the end of the 21st century) in the center time of the discharges are also projected for these rivers. As the basin is considered water-stressed and the region is strongly influenced by water-scarcity events, these unfavorable changes may potentially increase water disputes among the basin countries.

AU  - Farías, Laura

T2  - Environmental Research Letters
AB  - Seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of biogeochemical variables, including nitrous oxide (N2O), an important climate active gas, were analyzed during monthly observations between 2002 and 2012 at an ocean Time-Series station in the coastal upwelling area off central Chile (36° 30.8′; 73° 15′). Oxygen, N2O, nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) showed clear seasonal variability associated with upwelling favorable winds (spring–summer) and also inter-annual variability, which in the case of N2O was clearly observed during the occurrence of N2O hotspots with saturation levels of up to 4849%. These hotspots consistently took place during the upwelling-favorable periods in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011, below the mixed layer (15–50 m depth) in waters with hypoxia and some accumulation. The N2O hotspots displayed excesses of N2O (ΔN2O) three times higher than the average monthly anomalies (2002–2012). Estimated relationships of ΔN2O versus apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and ΔN2O versus suggest that aerobic ammonium oxidation (AAO) and partial denitrification are the processes responsible for high N2O accumulation in subsurface water. Chl-a levels were reasonably correlated with the presence of the N2O hotspots, suggesting that microbial activities fuelled by high availability of organic matters lead to high N2O production. As a result, this causes a substantial N2O efflux into the atmosphere of up to 260 μmol m−2 d−1. The N2O hotspots are transient events or hot moments, which may occur more frequently than they are observed. If so, this upwelling area is producing and emitting greater than expected amounts of N2O and is therefore an important N2O source that should be considered in the global atmospheric N2O balance.

AB  - The resilience perspective has emerged as a plausible approach to confront the increasingly devastating impacts of disasters; and the challenges and uncertainty climate change poses through an expected rise in frequency and magnitude of hazards. Stakeholder participation is posited as pivotal for building resilience, and resilience is not passive; rather, stakeholders are actively involved in the process of building resilience. Who is involved and how they are involved are crucial aspects for developing resilience in practice. Nevertheless, there are few empirical studies available to inform theory or show how these issues are addressed. This study focuses on revealing how practitioners frame the issue of participation in relation to resilience, its relevance to a changing climate and how, in consequence, they construct practices.

TI  - Characterization of the 1970s climate shift in South America
AU  - Jacques-Coper, Martín
AU  - Garreaud, René D.
T2  - International Journal of Climatology
AB  - The 1976-1977 cold-to-warm sea surface temperature (SST) shift in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which has been associated with a phase change of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, separated a 'La Niña-like' decadal regime from an 'El Niño-like' one. In this article, we analyse the differences of mean of annual and austral-summer (DJF) temperature, precipitation, and sea-level pressure (SLP) over South America (SA) between 1961-1973 and 1978-1990, and explore the occurrence of significant shifts in their time series. Our sources are instrumental records, gridded interpolated data, and reanalyses. Although major regional differences in the intensity of the signal are detected, the climate shift is identified in all variables. In the mid-1970s at annual level, reanalysis SLP data reveal the onset of a step-like anticyclonic circulation anomaly in the southern tip of SA and an abrupt weakening of the Southeast Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone (SEPA). This latter feature may have partly induced the rapid warming observed along the tropical-extratropical west coast of the continent through the weakening of the cold Humboldt current system. An abrupt warming was also detected in surface air temperature (SAT) composites located along the coast of the northern part of SA and in Southeastern SA (SESA). During summer, we found a particularly conspicuous shift-like warming over Southern South America (SSA, comprising Patagonia). Besides, a shift-like increase (decrease) in annual mean precipitation is observed over Central Argentina and in the tropics, to the south (north) of 10°S. In line with previous studies, we conclude that both the interannual (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and the interdecadal (PDO) variability modes seem to have had an incidence in the manifestation of the 1970s climate shift, and that its magnitude appears to be unprecedented during the 20th century, as shown in particular by century-long SAT composites from northern Chile and SSA.

AB  - Over much of the ocean’s surface, productivity and growth are limited by a scarcity of bioavailable nitrogen. Sedimentary δ15N records spanning the last deglaciation suggest marked shifts in the nitrogen cycle during this time, but the quantification of these changes has been hinderedby the complexity of nitrogen isotope cycling. Herewe present a database of δ15Nin sediments throughout the world’s oceans, including 2,329 modern seafloor samples, and 76 timeseries spanning the past 30,000 years. We showthat the δ15Nvalues of modern seafloor sediments are consistent with values predicted by our knowledge of nitrogen cycling in thewater column. Despite many local deglacial changes, the globally averaged δ15N values of sinking organic matter were similar during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene. Considering the global isotopic mass balance, we explain these observations with the following deglacial history of nitrogen inventory processes. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the nitrogen cycle was near steady state. During the deglaciation, denitrification in the pelagic water column accelerated. The flooding of continental shelves subsequently increased denitrification at the seafloor, and denitrification reached near steady-state conditions again in the Early Holocene.We use a recent parameterization of seafloor denitrification to estimate a 30–120% increase in benthic denitrification between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago. Based on the similarity of globally averaged δ15N values during the Last Glacial Maximum and Early Holocene, we infer that pelagic denitrification must have increased by a similar amount between the two steady states.

T2  - Climate of the Past
AB  - Both historical and idealized climate model experiments are performed with a variety of Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) as part of a community contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. Historical simulations start at 850 CE and continue through to 2005. The standard simulations include changes in forcing from solar luminosity, Earth's orbital configuration, CO2, additional greenhouse gases, land use, and sulphate and volcanic aerosols. In spite of very different modelled pre-industrial global surface air temperatures, overall 20th century trends in surface air temperature and carbon uptake are reasonably well simulated when compared to observed trends. Land carbon fluxes show much more variation between models than ocean carbon fluxes, and recent land fluxes appear to be slightly underestimated. It is possible that recent modelled climate trends or climate–carbon feedbacks are overestimated resulting in too much land carbon loss or that carbon uptake due to CO2 and/or nitrogen fertilization is underestimated. Several one thousand year long, idealized, 2 × and 4 × CO2 experiments are used to quantify standard model characteristics, including transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities, and climate–carbon feedbacks. The values from EMICs generally fall within the range given by general circulation models. Seven additional historical simulations, each including a single specified forcing, are used to assess the contributions of different climate forcings to the overall climate and carbon cycle response. The response of surface air temperature is the linear sum of the individual forcings, while the carbon cycle response shows a non-linear interaction between land-use change and CO2 forcings for some models. Finally, the preindustrial portions of the last millennium simulations are used to assess historical model carbon-climate feedbacks. Given the specified forcing, there is a tendency for the EMICs to underestimate the drop in surface air temperature and CO2 between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age estimated from palaeoclimate reconstructions. This in turn could be a result of unforced variability within the climate system, uncertainty in the reconstructions of temperature and CO2, errors in the reconstructions of forcing used to drive the models, or the incomplete representation of certain processes within the models. Given the forcing datasets used in this study, the models calculate significant land-use emissions over the pre-industrial period. This implies that land-use emissions might need to be taken into account, when making estimates of climate–carbon feedbacks from palaeoclimate reconstructions.

AB  - The potential of landscapes to supply multiple benefits to society beyond commodities production has received increasing research and policy attention. Linking the concept of multifunctionality with the ecosystem services (ES) approach offers a promising avenue for producing scientific evidence to inform landscape planning, e.g., about the relative utility of land-sharing and land-sparing. However, the value for decision-making of ES-based multifunctionality assessments has been constrained by a significant conceptual and methodological dispersion. To contribute towards a cohesive framework for landscape multifunctionality, we analyse case studies of joint ES supply regarding ten criteria designed to ultimately answer four aspects: (i) the multifunctionality of what (e.g., landscapes), (ii) the type of multifunctionality (e.g., based on ES synergies), (iii) the procedure of multifunctionality assessments, and (iv) the purpose of multifunctionality. We constructed a typology of methodological approaches based on scores for criteria describing the evaluation method and the level of stakeholder participation in assessments of joint ES supply. Surveyed studies and underlying types of methodological approaches (spatial, socio-spatial, functional, spatio-functional) differed in most criteria. We illustrate the influence of methodological divergence on planning recommendations by comparing two studies employing contrasting approaches (spatial and functional) to assess the joint supply of wildlife habitat and agricultural production in the Argentine Chaco. We distinguish between a pattern-based and process-based multifunctionality, where the latter can only be detected through approaches considering the ecological processes (e.g., ES complementarities) supporting the supply of multiple ES (functional and spatio-functional). Finally, we propose an integrated approach for assessing a socially-relevant process-based multifunctionality.

AB  - Stretching over 4300 km north to south, Chile is a special country with complicated landscapes and rich biodiversity. Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.

AB  - The occurrence of a summer DMS paradox in the vast subtropical gyres is a strong matter of debate because approaches using discrete measurements, climatological data and model simulations yielded contradictory results. The major conclusion of the first appraisal of prognostic ocean DMS models was that such models need to give more weight to the direct effect of environmental forcings (e.g. irradiance) on DMS dynamics to decouple them from ecological processes. Here, the relative role of light and phosphorus on summer DMS dynamics in subtropical waters is assessed using the ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model NEMO-PISCES in which macronutrient concentrations were restored to monthly climatological data values to improve the representation of phosphate concentrations. Results show that the vertical and temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMS concentrations observed in the Sargasso Sea during the summer months is captured by the model. Additional sensitivity tests show that the simulated control of phosphorus on surface DMS concentrations in the Sargasso Sea is much more important than that of light. By extending the analysis to the whole North Atlantic Ocean, we show that the longitudinal distribution of DMS during summer is asymmetrical and that a correlation between the solar radiation dose and DMS concentrations only occurs in the Sargasso Sea. The lack of a widespread summer DMS paradox in our model simulation as well as in the comparison of discrete and climatological data could be due to the limited occurrence of phosphorus limitation in the global ocean.

T2  - Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science
AB  - The Tubul-Raqui estuary is a coastal system off central Chile at 37°S, adjacent to an active coastal upwelling area, which undergoes rapid changes associated with natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578%) and CH4 (up to 6200%) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from-319 to 714mmolm-2d-1) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5mmolm-2d-1) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 μmol m-2 d-1. These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

La investigación se centra en el problema ambiental desde tres ámbitos sociales: público, privado y conocimiento experto. El estudio identificó la existencia de tres tipos de obstáculos que dificultarían el diálogo entre los actores que son parte de la discusión, así como el tratamiento del problema socioambiental, estos son: obstáculos a nivel de institucionalidad y normativa vigente; obstáculos a nivel del actuar y de las relaciones entre los actores; y obstáculos que se presentan a nivel de los significados asignados al problema. En el presente artículo se abordan los últimos dos tipos de obstáculos desde una perspectiva sistémico constructivista.

T2  - Climate of the Past
AB  - Glacier behaviour during the mid-Holocene (MH, 6000 years BP) in the Southern Hemisphere provides observational data to constrain our understanding of the origin and propagation of palaeoclimate signals. In this study we examine the climatic forcing of glacier response in the MH by evaluating modelled glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) and climatic conditions during the MH compared with pre-industrial time (PI, year 1750). We focus on the middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, specifically Patagonia and the South Island of New Zealand. Climate conditions for the MH were obtained from PMIP2 model simulations, which in turn were used to force a simple glacier mass balance model to simulate changes in ELA. In Patagonia, the models simulate colder conditions during the MH in austral summer (-0.2 °C), autumn (-0.5 °C), and winter (-0.4), and warmer temperatures (0.2 °C) during spring. In the Southern Alps the models show colder MH conditions in autumn (-0.7 °C) and winter (-0.4 °C), warmer conditions in spring (0.3 °C), and no significant change in summer temperature. Precipitation does not show significant changes but exhibits a seasonal shift, with less precipitation from April to September and more precipitation from October to April during the MH in both regions. The mass balance model simulates a climatic ELA that is 15-33 m lower during the MH compared with PI conditions. We suggest that the main causes of this difference are driven mainly by colder temperatures associated with the MH simulation. Differences in temperature have a dual effect on glacier mass balance: (i) less energy is available for ablation during summer and early autumn and (ii) lower temperatures cause more precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain in late autumn and winter, resulting in more accumulation and higher surface albedo. For these reasons, we postulate that the modelled ELA changes, although small, may help to explain larger glacier extents observed by 6000 years BP in South America and New Zealand.

AB  - The literature on ecosystem services mapping presents a diversity of procedures whose consistency might question the reliability of maps for decision-making. This study aims at analyzing the correspondence between the purpose of maps (e.g. land use planning) and the procedures used for mapping (e.g. benefit transfer, ecological transfer). Fifty scientific studies published between 2005 and 2012 were selected and analyzed according to 19 variables, applying independence tests over contingency tables, ANOVA and regression analysis. The results show that most studies declared a decision-making purpose (82%), which in 50% of the cases, was land use planning. Only few relationships were found between variables selected to describe the purpose of the maps and those selected to describe the mapping procedures. Thus for example, maps aimed at supporting land use planning did not include any level of stakeholder participation or scenario analysis, as it would have been expected given this purpose. Likewise, maps were based on either economic value or biophysical transfers, regardless of the spatial and temporal scales of mapping. This generally weak relation between map׳s purposes with the used procedures could explain the still restricted incidence of ES on decision-making by limiting the transmission, comparison and synthesis of results.

AB  - The fire season of 2014–2015 in Chile has been one of the worst of the last 50 years, with large and simultaneous fires affecting vast areas of Andean Araucaria–Nothofagus forests in several national parks, forest reserves and private properties. The worst-affected protected areas are China Muerta and Malleco National Reserves, and Conguillío and Tolhuaca National Parks, with an estimated total area of.12,000 ha burned. In 2002 fires burned.20,000 ha, af- fecting mostly the same protected areas and other private land covered by Araucaria forests, with c. 30 and 60%of the total area of Malleco National Reserve and Tolhuaca National Park burned, respectively. As then, the 2014–2015 fires have stirred public, political and scientific concern.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate on the growth of trees is important to project the response of forests to climate change. Dendrochronological analysis offers a “proxy” source for the effects of climatic variation on tree growth at different spatial and temporal scales. To examine influences of temperature and precipitation on radial growth of Pinus pseudostrobus and Abies religiosa, this study combines measurements of radial growth patterns of forest trees in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) in central Mexico with temperature and precipitation variables from instrumental records. Dendrochronological samples were collected as cross sections and increment cores by using a chainsaw and increment borers, respectively. Total ring-width chronologies were developed for each site. Principal component analyses (PCA) were used to identify common temperature, precipitation and tree growth variation patterns. Correlation and response function analyses between chronologies and records of temperature and precipitation were used to evaluate the relation of climate variables on tree growth. The months during which tree growth was most strongly affected by precipitation were January, February and October from the previous year; only the temperature of September from the previous year affected the tree growth. In some chronologies, May’s average monthly maximum temperature was negatively correlated with tree growth. PCA and a comparison of PCA factor scores of climatic variables and chronologies showed no significant differences between northern, central or southern portions of the MBBR. Apparently, tree growth in the MBBR is reduced in years of low January–May precipitation combined with high summer (September of the previous year) temperatures, a scenario which is likely to occur as a consequence of global climate change.

AB  - During the last deglaciation, the opposing patterns of atmospheric CO2 and radiocarbon activities (Δ14C) suggest the release of 14C-depleted CO2 from old carbon reservoirs. Although evidences point to the deep Pacific as a major reservoir of this 14C-depleted carbon, its extent and evolution still need to be constrained. Here we use sediment cores retrieved along a South Pacific transect to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of Δ14C over the last 30,000 years. In ~2,500–3,600 m water depth, we find 14C-depleted deep waters with a maximum glacial offset to atmospheric 14C (ΔΔ14C=−1,000‰). Using a box model, we test the hypothesis that these low values might have been caused by an interaction of aging and hydrothermal CO2 influx. We observe a rejuvenation of circumpolar deep waters synchronous and potentially contributing to the initial deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2. These findings constrain parts of the glacial carbon pool to the deep South Pacific.

AB  - The identification of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3–N) origin is important in the control of surface and ground water quality. These are the main sources of available drinking water. Stable isotopes (15N and 18O) for NO3–N and along with a 1-D reactive transport model were used to study the origin and processes that lead to nitrogen transformation and loss in a major stream that flows into a reservoir within an intensively cultivated catchment area (352 km2) in Alentejo-Portugal. Seasonal water samples (October–November 2008, March 2009 and September 2009) of stream surface water, wells and sediment pore water were collected. The results showed consistently increasing isotope values and decreasing NO3–N concentrations downstream. During winter (wet period, November 2008 and March 2009) slightly higher NO3–N concentrations were found in comparison to early fall (dry period: October 2008) and summer (dry period: September 2009). Isotopic composition of 15N and 18O values in surface water samples from the stream and wells indicated that the dominant NO3–N sources were derived mainly from the soil and fertilizers. There was also significant nitrification in surface water at the head of the stream. Sediment pore waters showed high NO3–N values near the sediment-water interface (reaching 25 mg·N·L−1) and NO3–N concentrations sharply decreasing with sediment depth, suggesting significant NO3–N consumption. Denitrification was also detected using the 15N signature in upstream waters, but not downstream where very low NO3–N levels were measured. In the stream, the calculated isotopic enrichment factor for NO3–N was −2.9‰ for 15N and −1.78 for 18O, this indicates that denitrification accounts for 7.8% to 48% of nitrate removal.

T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - Modeling and mapping of cultural ecosystem services (CES) represents a significant gap in ecosystem service research. A GIS-based methodological framework was developed and applied to map agricultural heritage (AH), understood as a non-divisible combination of three cultural services (dimensions, D): the heritage value associated to a culturally significant species (i.e. Chiloé native potato) (D1); the traditional systems of knowledge of AH keepers (D2); and the social relations among them (D3). The final aim of the study was to provide indicators of the "final" service (AHi, measured in a 0-100 point scale) and its benefits (AHB, measured in US$/ha), capable to display areas where high value farmland was located. In essence, AHi comprised a set of biocultural variables validated and weighted by expert opinion. The experts gave the maximum importance to 5 variables: number of native potato varieties cultivated (D1), use of own seed (D1), form in which cultivation knowledge was acquired by the keeper (D2), exchange of own seed (D3), and number of other potato keepers known (D3). In turn, AHB reflected society's willingness to pay for the nonmaterial benefits of AH conservation. Since these benefits "propagate" across space extending from local to unknown and distant beneficiaries, and the aim was to identify the most valuable areas for their capacity to satisfy a potential demand, AHB was spatialized following the approach of "ascribing" the potential benefits to their "point of provision". Thus the highest values of AHi coincided with the highest values of AHB (US$10.64-8.64 ha-1) a comprised 5608 ha of the landscape, and similarly the lowest values of AHi matched the lowest values of AHB (US$1.69-0.18 ha-1) comprising 13,070 ha of the landscape. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine the timing and magnitude of the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the last glacial termination (LGT) in northwestern Patagonia, situated in the middle latitudes of South America. Our data indicate that the main phase of the LGT began with abrupt warm pulses at 17,800 and 17,100calyrs BP, accompanied by rapid establishment of evergreen temperate rainforests and extensive deglaciation of the Andes within 1000 years. This response shows that South American middle-latitude temperatures had approached average interglacial values by 16,800calyrs BP. The temperature rise in northwestern Patagonia coincides with the beginning of major warming and glacier recession in the Southern Alps of New Zealand at southern mid-latitudes on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean. From this correspondence, the warming that began at 17,800calyrs BP appears to have been widespread in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, accounting for at least 75% of the total temperature recovery from the LGM to the Holocene. Moreover, this warming pulse is coeval with the first half of the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) in the North Atlantic region. HS1 featured a decline of North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a southward shift of the westerly wind belt in both hemispheres and of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, as well as a weakening of the Asian monsoon. Along with the initiating trigger, identifying the mechanisms whereby these opposing climate signals in the two polar hemispheres interacted -whether through an oceanic or an atmospheric bipolar seesaw, or both- lies at the heart of understanding the LGT.

AB  - Ozone (O3) soundings have been performed on Easter Island or Rapa Nui (27 °S, 109 °W, 51 m a.s.l.) since 1994 as part of the Global Atmospheric Watch Programme of the World Meteorological Organization. In this work, we analyse 260 soundings compiled over the period 1994–2014, and make the data available for the international community. We characterise O3 profiles over this remote area of the Pacific by means of statistical analyses that consider, on the one hand, a traditional climatology that describes the data in terms of seasonal cycles based on monthly averages and, on the other hand, a process-oriented analysis based on self-organising maps. Our analyses show the influence of both tropical and subtropical/mid-latitude air masses at Rapa Nui. The former occurs in summer and fall when convective conditions prevail, and the latter in late winter and spring when subsiding conditions are recurrent. The occurrence of stratospheric intrusions in late winter and spring in connection with deep troughs and the presence of the subtropical jet stream is also apparent in the data set. The tropospheric ozone column is in good agreement with the corresponding data derived from satellites but with a systematic overestimate of summer and fall values. There is evidence of an upward trend in ozone near the surface, which suggests the impact of local pollution. We look forward to an enhancement of the Rapa Nui observing site, given its location that offers a privileged position to observe climate change over the sparsely sampled and vast South Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Biodiversity is considered to be an essential element of the Earth system, driving important ecosystem services. However, the conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changingworld is a challenging task which requires cost- efficient and precise monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth native forest ecosystemwas examined. The vascular plant richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub andherb richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As species richness values are typically count data, the cor- responding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error distribution has to be considered. In this context,we compared the suitability of randomforest (RF) and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM)with a negative binomial error distribution. Both models were coupled with a feature selection approach to identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three most im- portant predictors for all four layers were altitude above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy height. Thiswas consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's suitability for estimating species richness,which is its capacity to capture three types of information: micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy struc- tural. Generalized LinearModels showed higher performances (r2: 0.66, 0.50, 0.52, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29%, 19.08%, 17.89%, 21.31% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r2: 0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30%, 21.90%, 18.95%, 21.00% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively). Furthermore, the results of the best GLMweremore parsimonious (three predictors) and less biased than the best RFmodels (twelve pre- dictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values, which RF is unable to properly capture. Fromanecological perspective, thepredicted patterns agreedwell with theknown vegetationcomposition of the area. We found especially high species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these areas, overlap- ping distributions of thermopile sclerophyllos species,water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur. The three main conclusions of the study are: 1) appropriatemodel selection is crucialwhenworkingwith biodiver- sitycountdata; 2) the applicationofRFfordatawithnon-symmetricerrordistributions isquestionable; and3) struc- tural and topographic information derived fromLiDAR data is useful for predicting local plant species richness. ©

AB  - Canopy gaps have been recognized as an important process in the regeneration dynamics of Andean old-growth forests (ca. 40º S). The objectives of the study were to determine main tree-fall gap attributes and to assess tree recruitment and growth patterns in tree-fall gaps of two mid-elevation Andean old-growth forests. We measured the canopy and expanded area of each gap, and for the gap-maker species we measured its diameter at breast height (dbh), felling direction and type of treefall. In each gap, tree seedlings, saplings and bamboo culms were counted in subplots. Increment cores of potential successors were obtained to examine growth patterns. There was a larger area in canopy gaps in NF than in STF (25.8 vs. 11.9 %). Expanded gaps were on average larger in NF than in STF (547 vs. 440 m2 ). Most gaps were originated by wind-snap and upturned root-plates of all the major tree species (Laureliopsis philippiana, Saxegothaea conspicua and Dasyphyllum diacanthoides, and Nothofagus dombeyi in NF). The understory species Chusquea culeou was an important competitor in gaps, especially in STF where the bamboo was more effective inhibiting the recruitment of tree seedlings. The successful recruitment of shade-tolerant tree species beneath endogenous tree-fall gaps indicates that these species follow a gap-phase regeneration mode through which –after several growth releases- they can reach the main canopy. These studies could offer valuable insights for the urgently required restoration and management of Andean old-growth forests.

AB  - Predicting how the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will change with global warming is of enormous importance to society 1-4. ENSO exhibits considerable natural variability at interdecadal–centennial timescales5. Instrumental records are too short to determine whether ENSO has changed6 and existing reconstructions are often developed without adequate tropical records. Here we present a seven-century-long ENSO reconstruction based on 2,222 tree-ring chronologies from both the tropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres. The inclusion of tropical records enables us to achieve unprecedented accuracy, as attested by high correlations with equatorial Pacific corals 7-8 and coherent modulation of global teleconnections that are consistent with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction9. Our data indicate that ENSO activity in the late twentieth century was anomalously high over the past seven centuries, suggestive of a response to continuing global warming. Climate models disagree on the ENSO response to global warming 3-4, suggesting that many models underestimate the sensitivity to radiative perturbations. Illustrating the radiative effect, our reconstruction reveals a robust ENSO response to large tropical eruptions, with anomalous cooling in the east-central tropical Pacific in the year of eruption, followed by anomalous warming one year after. Our observations provide crucial constraints for improving climate models and their future projections.

AB  - Mineral dust aerosols play a major role in present and past climates. To date, we rely on climate models for estimates of dust fluxes to calculate the impact of airborne micronutrients on biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a new global dust flux data set for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions based on observational data. A comparison with dust flux simulations highlights regional differences between observations and models. By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of <10ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further ∼10ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the capabilities of soil water balance modeling to estimate ET for very different conditions of rainfed grapevine water status, within a vineyard landscape that depicts heterogeneities in canopy, soil and water table conditions. We calibrated the HYDRUS-1D model against measurements of the soil moisture profile within seven contrasted sites, we validated HYDRUS-1D simulations against ET estimates derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements within two contrasted sites, and we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the HYDRUS-1D ET simulations throughout almost two growth cycles for the seven sites. The calibration of HYDRUS-1D was correctly achieved, with a relative RMSE of 20% on average. Validation of HYDRUS-1D simulations against EC measurements was satisfactory, with RMSE values of about 40 W m−2 at the hourly timescale and 0.5 mm d−1 at the daily timescale. HYDRUS-1D was able to provide consistent time series of ET within the seven contrasted sites and throughout the two growth cycles. We conclude that HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used as an alternative to EC measurements within rainfed vineyards, to alleviate experimental efforts for device cost and maintenance. Further, HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used for characterizing spatial variabilities and temporal dynamics, assessing impact of pedological conditions and land use on ET, or validating remote sensing retrievals over regional extents.

AB  - Questions

Is the macrolichen Usnea antarctica a ‘nurse’ species to Antarctic flora? Are positive plant–plant interactions more frequent than negative interactions in Antarctic ecosystems? Are microclimatic modifications by cushions of U. antarctica responsible for the nurse effect?


Location

Two sites in Antarctica: King George Island, South Shetland (62°11′ S, 58°56′ W; 62°11′ S, 58°59′ W).


Methods

We evaluated the association of plant species with U. antarctica cushions by recording species growing – in equivalent areas – within and outside U. antarctica cushions. Additionally, we performed transplant experiments with Deschampsia antarctica individuals to assess if U. antarctica cushions enhance plant survival. In both study sites we monitored temperature, moisture and nutrient status of soil outside and within the cushions to provide insights into potential mechanisms underlying possible interactions between U. antarctica and other plant species.


Results

Eight out of 13 species were positively associated with cushions of the widespread lichen U. antarctica, while only one species (U. aurantiaco-atra) showed a negative association with U. antarctica. Survival of Deschampsia was enhanced when growing associated with U. antarctica cushions. Our results indicate that cushions ameliorated the extreme conditions of Antarctic islands through increased temperature and soil moisture, decreased radiation and evaporative water loss and increased nutrient availability.


Conclusions

The nurse effect of U. antarctica is verified. Cushions of this macrolichen may be a key component in structuring the Antarctic landscape and maintaining local species richness, and their presence might influence range expansion of other species.

AB  - The concentration of greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and compounds such as total dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPt), along with other oceanographic variables were measured in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean within the Eurasian Basin (EAB). The EAB is affected by the perennial ice-pack and has seasonal microalgal blooms, which in turn may stimulate microbes involved in trace gas cycling. Data collection was carried out on board the LOMROG III cruise during the boreal summer of 2012. Water samples were collected from the surface to the bottom layer (reaching 4300 m depth) along a South-North transect (SNT), from 82.19°N, 8.75°E to 89.26°N, 58.84°W, crossing the EAB through the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. The Polar Mixed Layer and halocline waters along the SNT showed a heterogeneous distribution of N2O, CH4 and DMSPt, fluctuating between 42-111 and 27–649% saturation for N2O and CH4, respectively; and from 3.5 to 58.9 nmol L−1 for DMSPt. Spatial patterns revealed that while CH4 and DMSPt peaked in the Nansen Basin, N2O was higher in the Amundsen Basin. In the Atlantic Intermediate Water and Arctic Deep Water N2O and CH4 distributions were also heterogeneous with saturations between 52% and 106% and 28% and 340%, respectively. Remarkably, the Amundsen Basin contained less CH4 than the Nansen Basin and while both basins were mostly under-saturated in N2O. We propose that part of the CH4 and N2O may be microbiologically consumed via methanotrophy, denitrification, or even diazotrophy, as intermediate and deep waters move throughout EAB associated with the overturning water mass circulation. This study contributes to baseline information on gas distribution in a region that is increasingly subject to rapid environmental changes, and that has an important role on global ocean circulation and climate regulation.

T2  - Monthly Weather Review
AB  - Northern Chile hosts the driest place on Earth in the Atacama Desert. Nonetheless, an extreme precipitation event affected the region on 24-26 March 2015 with 1-day accumulated precipitation exceeding 40 mm in several locations and hourly mean rainfall rates higher than 10 mm h−1, producing floods and resulting in casualties and significant damage. The event is analyzed using ERA-Interim reanalysis, surface station data, sounding observations and satellite based radar. Two main conditions favorable for precipitation were present at the time of the event: (i) a cut-off low (COL) off the coast of Northern Chile and (ii) positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the eastern tropical Pacific. The circulation driven by the COL was strong but not extraordinary. A regional climate model (RegCM4) is used to test the sensitivity of precipitation to SST anomalies by removing the warm SST anomaly in the eastern tropical Pacific. The cooler simulation produced a very similar COL dry dynamics than that simulated in a control run (with observed SST), but, suppressed the precipitation by 60-80% over Northern Chile and 100% in parts of the Atacama Desert due to the decreased availability of precipitable water. The results indicate that the warm SST anomaly over eastern Pacific, favored by the onset of El Niño 2015-2016, was instrumental to the extreme precipitation event by providing an anomalous source of water vapor transported to Atacama by the circulation ahead of the COL.

AB  - This article is a review of the science goals and activities initiated within the framework of the Pollution and its Impacts on the South American Cryosphere (PISAC) initiative. Air pollution associated with biomass burning and urban emissions affects extensive areas of South America. We focus on black carbon (BC) aerosol and its impacts on air quality, water availability, and climate, with an emphasis on the Andean cryosphere. BC is one of the key short-lived climate pollutants that is a topic of growing interest for near-term mitigation of these issues. Limited scientific evidence indicates that the Andean cryosphere has already responded to climate change with receding glaciers and snow cover, which directly affect water resources, agriculture, and energy production in the Andean region of South America. Despite the paucity of systematic observations along the Andes, a few studies have detected BC on snow and glaciers in the Andes. These, in addition to existing and projected emissions and weather patterns, suggest a possible contribution of BC to the observed retreat of the Andean cryosphere. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of these issues from scientific and policy perspectives, and propose strategic expansions to the relevant measurement infrastructure in the region.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are widely distributed primary producers with significant implications for the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria of subsection V (Order Stigonematales) are particularly ubiquitous in photoautotrophic microbial mats of hot springs. The Stigonematal cyanobacterium strain CHP1 isolated from the Porcelana hot spring (Chile) was one of the major contributors of the new nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Further morphological and genetic characterization verified that the strain CHP1 belongs to Stigonematales, and it formed a separate clade together with other thermophiles of the genera Fischerella and Mastigocladus. Strain CHP1 fixed maximum N2 in the light, independent of the temperature range. At 50 °C nifH gene transcripts showed high expression during the light period, whereas the nifH gene expression at 45 °C was arrhythmic. The strain displayed a high affinity for nitrate and a low tolerance for high ammonium concentrations, whereas the narB and glnA genes showed higher expression in light and at the beginning of the dark phase. It is proposed that Mastigocladus sp. strain CHP1 would represent a good model for the study of subsection V thermophilic cyanobacteria, and for understanding the adaptations of these photoautotrophic organisms inhabiting microbial mats in hot springs globally.

T2  - Journal of Marine Research
AB  - Strong accumulations of N2O at oxyclines are some of the most conspicuous features of the world’s oceans. However, the origin of these maxima, and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in N2O cycling, remains unclear. In order to gain insight into the importance of denitrification and factors regulating N2O cycling at upper oxyclines in the eastern South Pacific, the production and consumption of N2O by denitrification were measured using a classical acetylene method under induced anoxia with the addition of an electron acceptor (nitrite) and donors (sodium acetate and glucose). The results indicated that decreased O2 clearly affected the ratio in which N2O is reduced to N2 at the midoxycline (∼40 m depth) and at the oxycline’s base (∼80 m depth). Under induced anoxia, higherN2Oproduction (fromNO− 2 toN2Oof 67.2 nM d−1) occurred at 40mdepth, with half of the total quantity being consumed by denitrification (from N2OtoN2 of 32 nM d−1); conversely,100%of theN2Owas reduced toN2 at 80mdepth. In comparison with previously reported results at the base of the oxycline at an offshore station, the addition ofNO− 2 (as sodium nitrite) along with dissolved organic carbon (as sodium acetate and glucose) doubled the net N2O production by denitrification (∼20 nM d−1). Our results suggest that decreasing O2 levels along with an increased availability of NO− 2 and organic compounds in the upper oxycline may impact the N2O/N2 ratio and, therefore, the N2O efflux to the atmosphere

AB  - Mesoscale eddies are important, frequent, and persistent features of the circulation in the eastern South Pacific (ESP) Ocean, transporting physical, chemical and biological properties from the productive shelves to the open ocean. Some of these eddies exhibit subsurface hypoxic or suboxic conditions and may serve as important hotspots for nitrogen loss, but little is known about oxygen consumption rates and nitrogen transformation processes associated with these eddies. In the austral fall of 2011, during the Tara Oceans expedition, an intrathermocline, anticyclonic, mesoscale eddy with a suboxic (< 2 µmol kg−1 of O2), subsurface layer (200–400 m) was detected  ∼  900 km off the Chilean shore (30° S, 81° W). The core of the eddy's suboxic layer had a temperature-salinity signature characteristic of Equatorial Subsurface Water (ESSW) that at this latitude is normally restricted to an area near the coast. Measurements of nitrogen species within the eddy revealed undersaturation (below 44 %) of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite accumulation (> 0.5 µM), suggesting that active denitrification occurred in this water mass. Using satellite altimetry, we were able to track the eddy back to its region of formation on the coast of central Chile (36.1° S, 74.6° W). Field studies conducted in Chilean shelf waters close to the time of eddy formation provided estimates of initial O2 and N2O concentrations of the ESSW source water in the eddy. By the time of its offshore sighting, concentrations of both O2 and N2O in the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eddy were lower than concentrations in surrounding water and “source water” on the shelf, indicating that these chemical species were consumed as the eddy moved offshore. Estimates of apparent oxygen utilization rates at the OMZ of the eddy ranged from 0.29 to 44 nmol L−1 d−1 and the rate of N2O consumption was 3.92 nmol L−1 d−1. These results show that mesoscale eddies affect open-ocean biogeochemistry in the ESP not only by transporting physical and chemical properties from the coast to the ocean interior but also during advection, local biological consumption of oxygen within an eddy further generates conditions favorable to denitrification and loss of fixed nitrogen from the system.

AB  - The understanding of the long-term variation of large rivers streamflow with a high economic and social relevance is necessary in order to improve the planning and management of water resources in different regions of the world. The Baker River has the highest mean discharge of those draining both slopes of the Andes South of 20°S and it is among the six rivers with the highest mean streamflow in the Pacific domain of South America (1100m3s-1 at its outlet). It drains an international basin of 29,000km2 shared by Chile and Argentina and has a high ecologic and economic value including conservation, tourism, recreational fishing, and projected hydropower. This study reconstructs the austral summer - early fall (January-April) streamflow for the Baker River from Nothofagus pumilio tree-rings for the period 1765-2004. Summer streamflow represents 45.2% of the annual discharge. The regression model for the period (1961-2004) explains 54% of the variance of the Baker River streamflow (R2adj=0.54). The most significant temporal pattern in the record is the sustained decline since the 1980s (τ=-0.633, p=1.0144*10-5 for the 1985-2004 period), which is unprecedented since 1765. The Correlation of the Baker streamflow with the November-April observed Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is significant (1961-2004, r=-0.55, p

AB  - Scholars have focused on understanding the motivations behind urban authorities' efforts to respond to climate change, yet the determinants of institutional response capacity are less well known, particularly in Latin America. This paper develops a framework to understand the political–economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and top-down decision making. However, both also have similar opportunities, such as leadership, participation in transnational networks, and potential to integrate climate change goals into existing policy agendas. Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity.

AB  - The climatology and recent trends of low-level coastal clouds at three sites along the northern Chilean coast (18.3°–23.4°S) are documented based upon up to 45 years of hourly observations of cloud type, coverage, and heights. Consistent with the subtropical location, cloud types are dominated by stratocumuli having greatest coverage (>7 oktas) and smaller heights (600–750 m) during the nighttime of austral winter and spring. Meridionally, nighttime cloud fraction and cloud-base heights increase from south to north. Long-term trends in mean cloud cover are observed at all sites albeit with a seasonal modulation, with increasing (decreasing) coverage in the spring (fall). Consistent trend patterns are also observed in independent sunshine hour measurements at the same sites. Cloud heights show negative trends of about 100 m decade−1 (1995–2010), although the onset time of this tendency differs between sites. The positive cloud fraction trends during the cloudy season reported here disagree with previous studies, with discrepancies attributed to differences in datasets used or to methodological differences in data analysis. The cloud-base height tendency, together with a less rapid lowering of the subsidence inversion base height, suggests a deepening of the coastal cloud layer. While consistent with the tendency toward greater low-level cloud cover and the known cooling of the marine boundary layer in this region, these tendencies are at odds with a drying trend of the near-surface air documented here as well. Assessing whether this intriguing result is caused by physical factors or by limitations of the data demands more detailed observations, some of which are currently under way.

AB  - Relationships between environmental factors and stem radius variation at short temporal scales can provide useful information regarding the sensitivity of tree species' productivity to climate change. This study used automatic point dendrometers to assess the relationship between environmental variables and stem radius contraction and increment in ten Fitzroya cupressoides trees growing in two sites, the Coastal Range (Alerce Costero National Park) and the Andean Cordillera (Alerce Andino National Park) of southern Chile. The growing season in each site, determined using stem daily cycle patterns for each month, was longer in the Coastal Range site than in the Andes. Warmer and sunnier conditions were positively related with daytime tree radius contraction in both areas, and relationships were stronger in the Coastal Range site where more pronounced shrinking events were associated with prolonged warm and dry conditions compared to the Andes. Stem increment was positively related with precipitation and humidity in both sites, reflecting the positive effect of water on cell turgidity and consequent enlargement. Relationships between stem radius change and environmental variables considering longer temporal scales (7 to 31 days), confirmed a stronger association with humidity/vapor pressure deficit and precipitation, rather than with temperature. Although Fitzroya grows in particularly wet and cool areas, current and projected drier and warmer summer conditions in southern Chile may have a negative effect on Fitzroya stem increment and carbon accumulation in both sites. This effect would be more critical in the Coastal Range compared with the Andes though, due in part to more limiting soil conditions and less summer precipitation in this area. Long-term research is needed to monitor different aspects of the response of these endangered ecosystems to this additional threat imposed by climate change.

T2  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
AB  - Identifying the key anthropogenic (land uses) and natural (topography and climate) biophysical drivers affecting river water quality is essential for efficient management of water resources. We tested the hypothesis that water quality can be predicted by different biophysical factors. Multivariate statistics based on a geographical information system (GIS) were used to explore the influence of factors (i.e., precipitation, topography, and land uses) on water quality (i.e., nitrate (NO 3 − ), phosphate (PO 4 3 − ), silicate (Si(OH)4), dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (TSS), biological oxygen demand (DO), temperature (T), conductivity (EC), and pH) for two consecutive years in the Itata and Biobío river watersheds, Central Chile (36° 00′ and 38° 30′). The results showed that (NO 3 − ), (PO 4 3 − ), Si(OH)4, TSS, EC, and DO were higher during rainy season (austral fall, winter, and spring), whereas BOD and temperature were higher during dry season. The spatial variation of these parameters in both watersheds was related to land use, topography (e.g., soil moisture, soil hydrological group, and erodability), and precipitation. Soil hydrological group and soil moisture were the strongest explanatory predictors for PO 4 3 − , Si(OH)4 and EC in the river, followed by land use such as agriculture for NO 3 − and DO and silviculture for TSS and Si(OH)4. High-resolution water leaching and runoff maps allowed us to identify agriculture areas with major probability of water leaching and higher probability of runoff in silviculture areas. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that land uses (agriculture and silviculture) explained in 60 % the river water quality variation. Our finding highlights the vulnerability of Chilean river waters to different biophysical drivers, rather than climate conditions alone, which is amplified by human-induced degradation.

AB  - The understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns in land use and land cover (LULC) change is a key issue for conservation efforts. In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970–1990 period. This decreased in the 1990–2000 period and rose again in the 2000–2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.

AB  - Numerous ice core records are now available that cover the Last Glacial cycle both in Greenland and in Antarctica. Recent developments in coherent ice core chronologies now enable us to depict with a precision of a few centuries the relationship between climate records in Greenland and Antarctica over the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period. Stacks of Greenland and Antarctic water isotopic records nicely illustrate a seesaw pattern with the abrupt warming in Greenland being concomitant with the beginning of the cooling in Antarctica at the Antarctic Isotopic Maximum (AIM). In addition, from the precise estimate of chronological error bars and additional high resolution measurements performed on the EDC and TALDICE ice cores, we show that the seesaw pattern does not explain the regional variability in Antarctic records with clear two step structures occurring during the warming phase of AIM 8 and 12. Our Antarctic high resolution data also suggest possible teleconnections between changes in low latitude atmospheric circulation and Antarctic without any Greenland temperature fingerprint.

AB  - Fixed points are fundamental states in any dynamical system. In the case of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles associated to the various cell types. We use Kauffman's approach to model GRNs with random Boolean networks (RBNs). In this paper we explore how the topology affects the distribution of the number of fixed points in randomly generated networks. We also study the size of the basins of attraction of these fixed points if we assume the α-asynchronous dynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). It is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cyclic attractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We observe the remarkable property that, in all our simulations, if for a given RBN with Barabási–Albert topology and α-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a fixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast, in the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a fixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller. We contrast the results of the simulations on Barabási–Albert networks with the classical Erdös–Rényi model of random networks. Everything indicates that Barabási–Albert networks are extremely robust. Finally, we study the mean and maximum time/work needed to reach a fixed point when starting from randomly chosen initial configurations.

T2  - Global Environmental Change
AB  - There is a growing use of resilience ideas within the disaster risk management literature and policy domain. However, few empirical studies have focused on how resilience ideas are conceptualized by practitioners, as they implement them in practice. Using Hajer's 'social-interactive discourse theory' this research contributes to the understanding of how practitioners frame, construct and make sense of resilience ideas in the context of changes in institutional arrangements for disaster risk management that explicitly include the resilience approach and climate change considerations. The case study involved the roll out of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia, and the study involved three sites in Queensland. The methods used were observation of different activities and the physical sites, revision of documents related to the Natural Disaster Resilience Program and in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants, all practitioners who had direct interaction with the program. The research findings show that practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience differently, and these are embedded in diverse storylines. Within these storylines, practitioners gave different interpretations and emphasis to the seven discourse categories that characterized their resilience discourse. Self-reliance emerged as one of the paramount discourse categories but we argue that caution needs to be used when promoting values of self-reliance. If the policy impetus is a focus on learning, research findings indicate it is also pertinent to move from experiential learning toward social learning. The results presented in this study provide helpful insights to inform policy design and implementation of resilience ideas in disaster risk management and climate change, and to inform theory.

T2  - Computers & Fluids
AB  - The particular conditions of air circulation inside large open pit mines under intense insolation, dominated by mechanical and buoyant effects, are crucial when studying the dispersion of pollutants inside and outside the pit. Considering this, we study this problem using CFD tools able to include the complex geometry characterizing it and the different processes affecting circulation: flow interaction with obstacles, buoyancy, stratification and turbulence. We performed simulations using a previously developed OpenFOAM solver, focusing in the particular case of Chuquicamata, a large open pit mine (∼1. km deep) located in northern Chile. Both idealized and real topographies were used. Given the importance of turbulence in this type of large-scale flows we have used LES to incorporate it in the calculation, using a DES approach to solve the flow near walls.The results from the idealized cases support the idea that buoyant currents foster the exit of particles from the pit and increase the turbulence inside its atmosphere, modifying the purely mechanical recirculatory flow inside the cavity. Differences in the air circulation and dispersion of particles between idealized and non-idealized cases are reported. In particular, there are changes in the intensity and location of the recirculation inside the pit due to variations in the aspect ratio (length/depth) of the cavity along the axis perpendicular to the main flow. Also, the topography surrounding the mine affects the main flow that sweeps the cavity, channeling it along the main axis of the pit and forcing it to enter the cavity through the lower level of the top edge. As a consequence, the patterns of pollutant transport observed in the idealized cases, dominated by near-wall upward currents, are different than those observed in the cases with complex topography, where the dispersion is dominated by internal buoyant upward currents. Anyhow, whether by internal or near wall upward currents, in all buoyant cases considered a large percentage of the particles injected inside the pit leaves the cavity.Further experiments studying the effect of 3D aspect ratio over the mechanically forced internal flow are needed to fully understand the effect of the internal geometry of the pit over the flow. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres
AB  - From 18 to 27 March 2015, northern, central, and southern Chile experienced a series of extreme hydrometeorological events. First, the highest surface air temperature ever recorded in Santiago (with reliable records dating to 1877), 36.8°C at Quinta Normal, was measured at 15:47 local time on 20 March 2015. Immediately following this high heat event, an extreme precipitation event, with damaging streamflows from precipitation totals greater than 45 mm, occurred in the semiarid and hyperarid Atacama regions. Finally, concurrent with the heavy precipitation event, extremely warm temperatures were recorded throughout southern Chile. These events were examined from a synoptic perspective with the goal of identifying forcing mechanisms and potential interaction between each analysis which provides operational context by which to identify and predict similar events in the future. Primary findings were as follows: (1) record warm temperatures in central Chile resulted from anomalous lower troposphere ridging and easterly downslope flow, both of which developed in response to an anomalous midtroposphere ridge-trough pattern; (2) a cutoff low with anomalous heights near one standard deviation below normal slowly moved east and was steered ashore near 25°S by circulation around a very strong ridge (anomalies more than 3 standard deviations above normal) centered near 60°S; (3) anomalously high precipitable water content (20 mm above climatological norms) over the Peruvian Bight region was advected southward and eastward ahead of the cutoff low by low-level northwesterly flow, greatly enhancing observed precipitation over northern Chile.

T2  - Disaster Prevention and Management
AB  - Purpose: To confront the increasingly devastating impacts of disasters and the challenges that climate change is posing to disaster risk management (DRM) there is an imperative to further develop DRM. The resilience approach is emerging as one way to do this, and in the last decade has been strongly introduced into the policy arena, although it is not new for DRM practitioners and researchers. Nevertheless, resilience is a highly contested issue, and there is no agreed definition of it, which has resulted in confusion for stakeholders when applying it to practice. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how resilience is framed by researchers and DRM practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical framework used was Hajer's "social-interactive discourse theory", combined with analysis of government documents, in-depth interviews with practitioners and observation of field and practices within the context of the Natural Disaster Resilience Program in Queensland, Australia. Findings: One of the key findings is that the idea of "bouncing back" is central to the resilience discourse but different interpretations of this idea results in real-world implications. Three different ways (storylines) in which practitioners construct the meaning of disaster resilience emerge from this study. Importantly the divergences between these storylines reveal possibilities for reframing to occur and these could lead to different policy options and practices. Originality/value: The results presented in this paper offer empirical evidence on how resilience is understood on the ground, contributing to extending resilience theory and informing DRM and resilience practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - While urbanites are vulnerable to a suite of risks that climate change might aggravate (e.g., mortality from extreme temperatures and property damages from floods), urban populations and decision makers may also be positioned to most effectively respond to such risks. Research is needed however, exploring both the multilevel factors and processes that determine urban risk and the complex pathways from hazards to impacts, and from perceptions and coping responses to adaptation. This paper analyzes whether and under what circumstances urban populations experience risk in selected Latin American neighborhoods of Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Mexico and Santiago; it assesses their adaptation capacity, i.e., ability to perceive and respond to hazards. It finds that urban risk depends on scale: hazards, adaptation capacities, responses and their underlying societal and physical drivers vary across urban households, neighborhoods and cities. Informality is a state of regulatory flux, where access to land and livelihood options cannot be fixed and mapped according to any prearranged sets of laws and planning mechanisms, that has a profound influence on risk and adaptation capacities across scales. For instance, informality becomes the site of considerable state power where some forms of growth in risk-prone areas enjoy state sanction while others are criminalized. The informal status becomes both a source of stigmatization that disempowers informal neighborhoods and a systemic determinant of lack of access to assets and options for adaptation capacity.

Cette situation n'a été pas été abordée de façon satisfaisante par les politiques publiques appropriées et n’a pas fait l’objet d’avancées théoriques innovantes dans la compréhension du problème. Dans le travail présenté, nous aborderons d'une manière synthétique quelques éléments conceptuels de l'étude des systèmes socio-écologiques dans le contexte du problème de pénurie et de vulnérabilité hydrique. La discussion présentée essaie de concilier les perspectives théoriques des systèmes complexes adaptatifs et des systèmes sociaux autopoiétiques (système qui peut maintenir sa structure globale en interaction avec son environnement, proche d’un système résilient). Notre objectif est de proposer des points de départ pour l'étude de ce phénomène, basés sur la littérature et des discussions actuelles, afin de mettre en avant des possibilités de rapprochement entre différentes matrices théoriques. Nous concluons en indiquant la nécessité de chercher des perspectives complémentaires et integrantes entre ces postures pour l'étude des problèmes environnementaux actuels.

AB  - Knowledge of the contribution that individual countries have made to global radiative forcing is important to the implementation of the agreement on “common but differentiated responsibilities” reached by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Over the past three decades, China has experienced rapid economic development, accompanied by increased emission of greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and aerosols, but the magnitude of the associated radiative forcing has remained unclear. Here we use a global coupled biogeochemistry–climate model and a chemistry and transport model to quantify China’s present-day contribution to global radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases, short-lived atmospheric climate forcers and land-use-induced regional surface albedo changes. We find that China contributes 10% ± 4% of the current global radiative forcing. China’s relative contribution to the positive (warming) component of global radiative forcing, mainly induced by well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols, is 12% ± 2%. Its relative contribution to the negative (cooling) component is 15% ± 6%, dominated by the effect of sulfate and nitrate aerosols. China’s strongest contributions are 0.16 ± 0.02 watts per square metre for CO2 from fossil fuel burning, 0.13 ± 0.05 watts per square metre for CH4, −0.11 ± 0.05 watts per square metre for sulfate aerosols, and 0.09 ± 0.06 watts per square metre for black carbon aerosols. China’s eventual goal of improving air quality will result in changes in radiative forcing in the coming years: a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions would drive a faster future warming, unless offset by larger reductions of radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon.

AB  - The online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was applied to simulate a haze event that happened in January 2010 in the North China Plain (NCP), and was validated against various types of measurements. The evaluations indicate that WRFChem provides reliable simulations for the 2010 haze event in the NCP. This haze event was mainly caused by high emissions of air pollutants in the NCP and stable weather conditions in winter. Secondary inorganic aerosols also played an important role and cloud chemistry had important contributions. Air pollutants outside Beijing contributed about 64.5% to the PM2.5 levels in Beijing during this haze event, and most of them are from south Hebei, Tianjin city, Shandong and Henan provinces. In addition, aerosol feedback has important impacts on surface temperature, relative humidity (RH) and wind speeds, and these meteorological variables affect aerosol distribution and formation in turn. In Shijiazhuang, Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) decreased about 278.2m and PM2.5 increased more than 20 μgm-3 due to aerosol feedback. It was also shown that black carbon (BC) absorption has significant impacts on meteorology and air quality changes, indicating more attention should be paid to BC from both air pollution control and climate change perspectives.

AB  - The improvement of solar thermal technologies in emerging economies like Chile is particularly attractive because the country is endowed with one of the most consistently high solar potentials, lithium and copper reserves. In recent years, growing interests for lithium based salts and copper foams in application of thermal technologies could change the landscape of Chile transforming its lithium reserves and copper availability into competitive energy produced in the region. This study reviews the technical advantages of using lithium based salts—applied as heat storage media and heat transfer fluid—and copper foam/Phase Change Materials (PCM) alternatives—applied as heat storage media—within tower and parabolic trough Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, and presents a first systematic evaluation of the costs of these alternatives based on real plant data. The methodology applied is based on material data base compilation of price and technical properties, selection of CSP plant and estimation of amount of required material, and analysis of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Results confirm that some lithium based salts are effective in reducing the amount of required material and costs for the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems for both plant cases, with savings of up to 68% and 4.14% in tons of salts and LCOE, respectively. Copper foam/PCM composites significantly increase thermal conductivity, decreasing the volume of the TES system, but costs of implementation are still higher than traditional options.

T2  - Dendrobiology
AB  - Little dendroclimatic research has been conducted on species of Podocarpus, in response to inherent difficulties associated with tree-ring differentiation and cross-dating. We sampled complete stem cross sections from a plantation of Podocarpus salignus trees in Valdivia, Chile, near the southern edge of the species’ range. We measured earlywood, latewood, and total ring widths avoiding ring wedging, and we calculated the corresponding chronologies. The relationship of these chronologies with maximum temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure was addressed using correlation and redundancy analyses. All chronologies showed a similar response to climate that was consistent with the cloudy, rainy, and temperate conditions of the study area. That is, warm and dry conditions during previous late springs were beneficial, while warm and rainy winters under low atmospheric pressures were detrimental for growth. The observed climatic responses are in contrast to those of conifers from mountainous areas of southern South America. Limitation of carbohydrates available for growth in the following active season was a possible cause for the observed responses to climate. That is, high winter temperatures may deplete stored carbohydrates by increasing respiration, and a high degree of cloud cover reduces the radiation received by the trees in the active season, which may hamper photosynthesis. Our work highlights the dendroclimatological value of Podocarpus salignus to investigate the influence of climatic variation on tree growth and forest productivity. © 2016 Polska Akademia Nauk.

T2  - Journal of Paleolimnology
AB  - This paper presents the first systematic investigation of stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) from the subfossil chironomid head capsules (HCs) of a single taxon (Chironomus). The study focuses on sixteen south-eastern Australian lakes and investigates the potential of Chironomus spp. HC stable isotopes to reconstruct past temperature changes from these lakes. The relationship between δ18O values of Chironomus spp. HCs from Australian oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes in humid areas and air temperature appears robust (r = 0.88) and in line with results from European lakes. Similar results were obtained for δ2H values and temperature (r = 0.94). For lakes that are located in semi-arid and sub-humid areas that have high evaporation compared to precipitation, and often long water residence time, the temperature relationship is not robust. This is due to the evaporative enrichment of δ18O values in lake water and the effect of salinity and higher nutrient status. Vital effects may also play a role. The overall findings of this study are that both Chironomus spp. HC δ18O and δ2H are potentially valuable tools for reconstructing temperature in cooler, low nutrient and low salinity lakes of Australia. In warmer, sub-humid to semi-arid regions, δ18O and δ2H may provide valuable information about past changes in hydrological conditions.

AB  - South America lost around 52 genera of mammals during a worldwide event known as the Late Quaternary Extinction episode. More than 80% of South American mammals weighing > 44 kg succumbed. Analysis of the megafaunal extinction chronology in relation to human arrival and major climate changes have revealed slightly different extinction patterns in different eco-regions of the continent, highlighting the importance of detailed regional analysis in order to understand how the possible drivers of extinction operated. Here we present an analysis of the megafaunal extinction in the Última Esperanza (UE) area of southwestern Patagonia, Chile. We have compiled a comprehensive chronology of megafaunal extinctions and earliest human occupation between 18–7 cal ka BP, based on radiocarbon dates from published literature. We calculated confidence intervals using the GRIWM method to estimate the times of human arrival and megafaunal local extinctions, and then compared these events to the timing of major climate and vegetation changes, fire frequency increase, and the Reclús volcanic eruption. Our results suggest that a combination of human impacts and climate–vegetation change drove megafaunal extinctions in the UE area, with the balance of factors being taxon specific; the volcanic eruption does not seem to have exacerbated extinctions. Competition between humans and mega-carnivores seems to be the most plausible cause for the extinction of the mega-carnivores. Coexistence of humans with extinct horses, extinct camels, and mylodonts for several thousand years rules out a scenario of blitzkrieg overkill of megafauna by humans. The transition of vegetation from cold grasslands to Nothofagus forests corresponds with the disappearance of Hippidion saldiasi and Lama cf. owenii. The later full establishment of Nothofagus forests and an increasing fire frequency coincided with the disappearance of mylodonts. A climate-driven reduction of open environments plausibly reduced herbivore's populations making them susceptible to local extinction.

AB  - The ongoing implementation of a fog observatory in a coastal fog forest in northern Chile is expected to provide valuable information to improve our comprehension of these ecosystems alongside retrieving valuable data to fog scientists. Observing this opportunity and the increase on radio astronomy instrumental it is proposed to develop a low-cost Cloud Radar reutilizing obsolete but operative radio telescope components and software defined radios for modulation. Only preliminary tests have been conducted so far to test the viability of this approach. These tests show that it is in fact possible to build an emitter and receiver operating at 35 GHz using radio telescope components as a Radio Frequency front-end, and that the detected echo coming from the signal is affected by the presence of liquid water droplets in the air. Further development is being carried on the prototype to enable the detection of fog droplets in the boundary layer up to 2 km of height.

AB  - The winter haze is a growing problem in North China, but the causes are not well understood. The chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Chem) was applied in North China to examine how PM2.5 concentrations change in response to changes in emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), ammonia (NH3), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)), as well as meteorology (temperature, relative humidity (RH), and wind speeds) changes in winter. From 1960 to 2010, the dramatic changes in emissions lead to +260 % increases in sulfate, +320 % increases in nitrate, +300 % increases in ammonium, +160 % increases in BC, and +50 % increases in OC. The responses of PM2.5 to individual emission species indicate that the simultaneous increases in SO2, NH3, and NOx emissions dominated the increases in PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 shows more notable increases in response to changes in SO2 and NH3 as compared to increases in response to changes in NOx emissions. In addition, OC also accounts for a large fraction in PM2.5 changes. These results provide some implications for haze pollution control. The responses of PM2.5 concentrations to temperature increases are dominated by changes in wind fields and mixing heights. PM2.5 shows relatively smaller changes in response to temperature increases and RH decreases compared to changes in response to changes in wind speed and aerosol feedbacks. From 1960 to 2010, aerosol feedbacks have been significantly enhanced due to higher aerosol loadings. The discussions in this study indicate that dramatic changes in emissions are the main cause of increasing haze events in North China, and long-term trends in atmospheric circulations may be another important cause since PM2.5 is shown to be substantially affected by wind speed and aerosol feedbacks. More studies are necessary to get a better understanding of the aerosol–circulation interactions.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - This paper presents a general framework to estimate the bus user time benefits of a median busway including the effects on travel time and access time. Unlike previous models, we take into account the effects of geometry and the interaction with the demand structure. Models for predicting the bus in-vehicle time benefits of a median dual carriageway busway against mixed traffic condition on 2 and 3 lanes roads are estimated using data from a case study in Santiago (Chile), using a bus travel time model empirically estimated and considering different base case situations, including mixed traffic operations and bus lanes. Results of the application show that the expected in-vehicle time savings of a median busway might be reduced by access time losses due to increased walking distances and road crossing delays. Also, that net time benefits can vary significantly according to the base situation and the structure of demand considered. These findings point out to the need of including a wider set of impacts when studying the benefits of median busways, beyond in-vehicle time savings only. The empirical work presented here is completely based on passive data coming from GPS and smartcards, what makes easier and cheaper to conduct this type of analysis as well as to do it with a comprehensive scope at an early stage of the development of a BRT project. This framework can be extended to other types of dedicated bus lanes provided that a corresponding bus travel time savings model is available.

Four headwaters in Southern Africa.
Study focus
The streamflow regimes in Southern Africa are amongst the most variable in the world. The corresponding differences in streamflow bias and variability allowed us to analyze the behavior and robustness of the LISFLOOD hydrological model parameters. A differential split-sample test is used for calibration using seven satellite-based rainfall estimates, in order to assess the robustness of model parameters. Robust model parameters are of high importance when they have to be transferred both in time and space. For calibration, the modified Kling-Gupta statistic was used, which allowed us to differentiate the contribution of the correlation, bias and variability between the simulated and observed streamflow.
New hydrological insights
Results indicate large discrepancies in terms of the linear correlation (r), bias (β) and variability (γ) between the observed and simulated streamflows when using different precipitation estimates as model input. The best model performance was obtained with products which ingest gauge data for bias correction. However, catchment behavior was difficult to be captured using a single parameter set and to obtain a single robust parameter set for each catchment, which indicate that transposing model parameters should be carried out with caution. Model parameters depend on the precipitation characteristics of the calibration period and should therefore only be used in target periods with similar precipitation characteristics (wet/dry).

AB  - En las últimas décadas, se han observado importantes cambios en torno a la relación entre la ciencia y la sociedad. Se ha transitado de un paradigma basado en que la ciencia está transformando la sociedad a otro que abre a la posibilidad de que la sociedad transforme la ciencia. El aporte de la esfera científica, al igual que el brindado por cada uno de los actores sociales, es fundamental para apoyar la toma de decisiones en política pública. Así lo ha demostrado el Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre Cambio Climático (IPCC), que ha jugado un rol clave en la toma de acciones de la comunidad internacional. Sin embargo, la relación entre ciencia y política no ha sido suficientemente fluida en Chile. El objetivo del estudio fue identificar y analizar, a través de motodología cualitativa de carácter exploratorio, las brechas y los facilitadores de la relación entre investigadores del campo de las ciencias naturales y las políticas públicas en Chile, con énfasis en el área del cambio climático. Esto permitió analizar la estructura y la dinámica de incentivos a la actividad de las esferas científica y pública, y los mecanismos de comunicación y coordinaci;ón existentes entre ellas. Así, se identificaron ocho brechas y dos facilitadores. Resaltan el bajo interés de la esfera científica en realizar "asesorías" solicitadas por servicios públicos que generan poíticas públicas, la falta de incentivos o exigencias académicas para simplificar contenidos, así como la falta de comunicación y de interacción regular que generan una diferencia entre lo que la esfera político-administrativa espera de los científicos y la forma en que estos últimos ven como efectiva y útil su participación. Además, se observaron fallas de coordinación entre quien financia la investigación y quien genera la política pública. Los resultados también muestran que las brechas entre las esferas no se recducen únicamente al campo del cambio climático, sino que se deben también a la manera como están conformadas las estructuras científicas y políticas de Chile.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms are an important source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) in aquatic environments. Identifying the impact of pH on N2O production by ammonia oxidizers is key to understanding how aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes will respond to naturally occurring pH changes, as well as acidification driven by anthropogenic CO2. We assessed N2O production rates and formation mechanisms by communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in a lake and a marine environment, using incubation-based nitrogen (N) stable isotope tracer methods with 15N-labeled ammonium (15NH4+) and nitrite (15NO2-), and also measurements of the natural abundance N and O isotopic composition of dissolved N2O. N2O production during incubations of water from the shallow hypolimnion of Lake Lugano (Switzerland) was significantly higher when the pH was reduced from 7.54 (untreated pH) to 7.20 (reduced pH), while ammonia oxidation rates were similar between treatments. In all incubations, added NH4+ was the source of most of the N incorporated into N2O, suggesting that the main N2O production pathway involved hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and/or NO2- produced by ammonia oxidation during the incubation period. A small but significant amount of N derived from exogenous/added 15NO2- was also incorporated into N2O, but only during the reduced-pH incubations. Mass spectra of this N2O revealed that NH4+ and 15NO2- each contributed N equally to N2O by a ‘hybrid-N2O’ mechanism consistent with a reaction between NH2OH and NO2-. Nitrifier denitrification was not an important source of N2O. Isotopomeric N2O analyses in Lake Lugano were consistent with incubation results, as 15N enrichment of the internal N versus external N atoms produced site preferences (25.0‰ to 34.4‰) consistent with NH2OH-dependent hybrid-N2O production. Hybrid-N2O formation was also observed during incubations of seawater from coastal Namibia with 15NH4+ and NO2-. However, the site preference of dissolved N2O here was low (4.9‰), indicating another mechanism, not captured during the incubations, was important. Multiplex sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed distinct ammonia oxidizer communities: AOB dominated numerically in Lake Lugano, and AOA dominated in the seawater. Potential for hybrid N2O formation exists among both communities, and at least in AOB-dominated environments, acidification may accelerate this mechanism.

AB  - Despite evidence from a number of Earth systems that abrupt temporal changes known as regime shifts are important, their nature, scale and mechanisms remain poorly documented and understood. Applying principal component analysis, change-point analysis and a sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts to 72 time series, we confirm that the 1980s regime shift represented a major change in the Earth's biophysical systems from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and occurred at slightly different times around the world. Using historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and statistical modelling of historical temperatures, we then demonstrate that this event was triggered by rapid global warming from anthropogenic plus natural forcing, the latter associated with the recovery from the El Chichón volcanic eruption. The shift in temperature that occurred at this time is hypothesized as the main forcing for a cascade of abrupt environmental changes. Within the context of the last century or more, the 1980s event was unique in terms of its global scope and scale; our observed consequences imply that if unavoidable natural events such as major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming unforeseen multiplier effects may occur.

Esa es la premisa bajo la cual el libro nos presenta una acabada revisión de 19 ensayos de destacados académicos y especialistas, que tratan sobre las organizaciones sociales, cómo se originan y por qué, cómo funcionan internamente, las atribuciones que han tomando y se les han otorgado, la proyección de ellas en la sociedad, sus nexos con grupos específicos y los problemas que deben enfrentar, entre otros tópicos.
Los autores nos invitan a desmenuzar las organizaciones sociales y la influencia que tienen en nuestras vidas, determinando el actuar social y valórico. Una necesaria revisión que nos acerca a entender la importancia de contar con ellas, de conocerlas, y de comprender el lugar que se les atribuye para conducir nuestros propios intereses y necesidades.

AB  - A group of researchers, consultants, software developers, and transit agencies convened in Santiago, Chile over 3 days as part of the Thredbo workshop titled “Harnessing Big Data”, to present their recent research and discuss the state of practice, state of the art, and future directions of big data in public transportation. This report documents their discussion. The key conclusion of the workshop is that, although much progress has been made in utilizing big data to improve transportation planning and operations, much remains to be done, both in terms of developing further analysis tools and use cases of big data, and of disseminating best practices so that they are adopted across the industry.

AB  - Promoting effective responses to climate change, especially among people who reject its anthropogenic causes, has been challenging. Following a qualitative study, we experimentally induce one of four frames of reference (identity, biodiversity conservation, economic prosperity, and climate change), and assess their effects on participants’ behavioral intentions using three scales (consumption-investment, consumption-reduction, and political participation). The sample (N = 156) included people who thought climate change is natural and those who thought it is human-induced. Results show a significant impact of the identity frame, relative to the climate-change frame, for both consumption scales, in the total sample, and among those who reject the anthropogenic causes. These results offer a way to address behavioral resistances associated with antagonistic views on climate change.

AB  - Este libro constituye una revisión y actualización de la primera edición del libro Ecología Forestal escrito hace ya más de 30 años, así como de los antecedentes sobre estructura y dinámica de bosques entregados hace 20 años en el texto Bosques Templados de Chile y Argentina. Como acertadamente se señala en el prólogo, en el marco del modelo esencialmente economicista en que vivimos, esta sociedad no reconoce, en parte porque lo ignora, que el manejo de los bosques con una base ecológica es necesario. Debemos asegurar que eso sea así y no perder de vista la importancia de los ecosistemas forestales y la necesidad de su conservación. Creemos que el contenido de este libro puede colaborar con ese propósito. La diversidad de temas incorporados se expresa en 19 capítulos que se refieren, entre otros, a la historia del nacimiento y desarrollo de la Ecología Forestal en Chile; las aves, y mamíferos del bosque; cambio climático; hidrobiología; sucesión y dinámica de bosques y la influencia de disturbios en los bosques templados de Chile y Argentina; la silvicultura y manejo de ecosistemas forestales; el manejo integrado de cuencas; los servicios ecosistémicos de los bosques nativos; la ecología de paisajes, restauración e invasiones de plantas en ecosistemas forestales; y la gobernanza del sector forestal chileno, enfatizando las tensiones y conflictos entre las fuerzas de mercado y las demandas ciudadanas.

AB  - Pleistocene glaciations produced significant increases in continental ice cover in polar and mid-latitude temperate areas, sea-level declines and shifts and reshuffling of biomes, all of which promote either isolation, coalescence or fragmentation in the distribution of land biota. If populations of several taxa have been co-distributed for a prolonged time, and if the periods between perturbation or vicariance processes have been more or less stable, it is expected that divergence patterns of closely related and ecologically similar species will be congruent because of their similar biological and demographic characteristics. Based on this premise, we analysed the phylogeographic structure (cytochrome b) of Liolaemus pictus and Batrachyla leptopus, two widely co-distributed lizard and frog species, respectively, in the Chiloé Archipelago of southern Chile, to decipher their genetic structure in response to a common climatic and environmental history. Haplotype network analysis and Bayesian inference suggest an evolutionary pattern of genetic diversity for the two species that is consistent with the Quaternary glacial history of southern Chile, and suggests a complex phylogeographic history in the Liolaemus and Batrachyla species. High-divergence levels among haplotypes in some island populations of the archipelago also suggest genetic connectivity between putative refuges from Chiloé Island and the mainland along the exposed continental shelf during sea level minima associated with the most recent Quaternary glaciations. Our results are consistent with our hypothesis that two species have responded to parallel historical events in which the historical process during the last glacial maximum (approximately 41°S) has been sufficient to influence their phylogeographic structure.

AB  - Cyanobacteria inhabit all possible habitats, performing crucial ecological services. Cyanobacterial photopigments generate a great diversity in color. They exhibit several types of chromatic adaptation, regulated at transcriptional and postranscriptional levels. Though all cyanobacteria are fundamentally oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, some species can switch their metabolic mode to, for example, anoxygenic photosynthesis, using sulfide. Many cyanobacteria produce extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) sheaths, which act as a buffer zone between the cell and the environment, and contribute to desiccation tolerance. In nitrogen-limited photic environments (especially those lacking nitrate and ammonium), cyanobacteria are the main diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) organisms. The process of nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria have evolved several strategies with different degrees of complexity to protect their nitrogenase from oxygen, which is present in the surrounding medium and also produced intracellularly.

T2  - the 1st International Workshop
AB  - Women are currently almost half of the work force in Chile, but very few of them work in the software industry. In part, this is because there are strong cultural stereotypes about what careers are "for men" in Chile. This idea has been further cemented by the standardized admissions process used by Chilean universities, where female mathematics scores have historically been lower than that of their male peers. In order to break these stereotypes and attract more women into STEM careers, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Chile has created the Gender Equality Admissions Program (PEG, for its name in Spanish, Programa de Ingreso Prioritario de Equidad de Génera) in 2013. Under this program, 40 extra women are selected into the most competitive engineering and science program in the country. In the five years that the PEG has been in place, the number of women accepted into the engineering and science program has grown from 19% to more than 32%. Moreover, we have started to see an increase in the enrollment of female students in Software Engineering courses. This growth goes beyond the 40 new female students per year.

AB  - The Energy Center has developed a co-construction methodology to address the challenges of technology transfer-based on distributed generation projects- in the context of energy transitions in isolated locations. Based on the experiences developed between 2010 and 2017, this paper analyses the process of preparing the Co-construction methodology. New tools were identified under the light of a theoretical-methodological reflection and a new version of co-construction methodology is proposed from this discussion. This learning process combines academic research and applied projects. It has provided Energy Center with an improved set of tools for current projects, and also contributed to a theoretical-methodological discussion based on new research activities. The main problems of method faced are presented during interdisciplinary work, such as: common understanding of fundamental concepts (sustainability, participation, community); the domination of one discipline over the others; the different visions of the priorities within the same project. And those problems given by the participation process under the paradox of “framing-overflowing”, where the constraints of actual projects (deadlines, budget, and specific KPIs) could limit the possibility of performing in depth diagnostics and building trust. One of the main challenges identified is that an actual impact on the overall experience is only feasible if lessons can be translated into concrete products (best practices, guidelines, tools), so can be adopted by future project developers.

AB  - A severe drought has affected central Chile since 2009. Various adaptation responses have been developed, and a participatory process is required to learn from them. To enable this, a transdisciplinary approach was adopted to achieve two objectives: first, to test an approach for assessing the effectiveness of existing measures to respond to drought, specifically to distil strengths and weaknesses of implementation, and developing recommendations; second, to reflect on results from a pilot project conducted to ascertain its potential for scalability in terms of processes employed. The research was organized per the three types of knowledge needed to address complex problems through transdisciplinarity: systems, target and transformation knowledge. Using the recent drought as a boundary object, we conducted the pilot in two locations in Chile where we carried out literature reviews, interviews and focus group discussions were carried out. We identified adaptation measures at national and local scale, a set of which were evaluated applying the Index for the Usefulness of Adaptation Practices (IUPA). Results indicate that through IUPA, we could systematically account for the perceived effectiveness of applied measures. Strengths such as autonomy in the decision-making process emerged as key factors that could also be applied in other contexts, whereas weaknesses such as lack of integration with other policy domains, programs or projects were identified. To address weaknesses, key recommendations were proposed, which are congruent with context-specific expectations, capacities, experiences and knowledge, given that they were articulated by local actors. Results present empirical evidence on the important utility of transdisciplinary approaches in the evaluation of adaptation measures and can support the development of metrics related to adaptation process at the local scale.

São Paulo, Brazil has experienced severe water shortages and record low levels of its water reservoirs in 2013–2014. We evaluate the contributions of Amazon deforestation and climate change to low precipitation levels using a modelling approach, and address whether similar precipitation anomalies might occur more frequently in a warming world. Precipitation records from INMET show that the dry anomaly extended over a fairly large region to the north of São Paulo. Unique features of this event were anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the Southern Atlantic, an extension of the sub tropical high into the São Paulo region and moisture flux divergence over São Paulo. The SST anomalies were very similar in 2013/14 and 2014/15, suggesting they played a major role in forcing the dry conditions. The SST anomalies consisted of three zonal bands: a cold band in the tropics, a warm band to the south of São Paulo and another cold band poleward of 40 S. We performed ensemble climate simulations with observed SSTs prescribed, vegetation cover either fixed at 1870 levels or varying over time, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) either fixed at pre-industrial levels (280 ppm CO2) or varying over time. These simulations exhibit similar precipitation deficits over the São Paulo region in 2013/14. From this, we infer that SST patterns and the associated large-scale state of the atmosphere were important factors in determining the precipitation anomalies, while deforestation and increased GHGs only weakly modulated the signal. Finally, analyses of future climate simulations from CMIP5 models indicate that the frequency of such precipitation anomalies is not likely to change in a warmer climate. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The increase of population has intensified everyday rush. Traffic congestions are still a problem in cities and are one of the main cause for public transport delays. City residents and visitors have experienced time loss by using public transport buses, because of waiting at the bus stops and not knowing if the bus is delayed or already serviced the stop. Therefore it is valuable for people to know at what time the bus should arrive (or is it already missed) at specific bus stop. Real-time public bus tracking and management system development has been the focus of many researchers, and many studies have been done in this area. This paper focuses on bus travel time prediction comparison between linear regression and support vector regression models (SVR), when using limited data set. Data were limited in a way that only historical GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates of bus location (recorded each 30 seconds) and driven distance were used, there were no information about arrival/departure times, delays or dwell times. Distance between stops and delay (assumed values based on route observations by authors) were used as inputs for both models. It was concluded that SVR algorithm showed better results, but the difference was not significantly large. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The halite-encrusted salt pans (salars) present at low elevations of the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile are unique features of one of the driest and possibly oldest deserts on Earth. Here we show that these landscapes were shallow freshwater lakes and wetlands during the last glacial period, periodically between ~46.9 ka and 7.7 ka. The moisture appears to have been sourced from increased Andean runoff and most of our chronologies for these deposits were coeval with the Central Andean Pluvial Event (17.5-14.2 ka and 13.8-9.7 ka), but we also find evidence for older as well as slightly younger wet phases. These environments supported a diverse hygrophyte vegetation, as well as an array of diatoms, ostracods and gastropods. Using a regional hydrological model, we estimate that recharge rates from 1.5 to 4 times present were required to activate and maintain these wetlands in the past. Activation in the late Pleistocene was part of a regional enhancement of water resources, extending from the Andes, downstream and through riparian corridors, to the lowest and most arid portions of the desert itself. This fundamentally unique environment was encountered by the earliest human explorers in the region, and most likely facilitated migration and encampments on a landscape that at present lacks macroscopic life on its surface.

AB  - In recent decades large fires have affected communities throughout central and southern Chile with great social and ecological consequences. Despite this high fire activity, the controls and drivers and the spatiotemporal pattern of fires are not well understood. To identify the large-scale trends and drivers of recent fire activity across six regions in south-central Chile (~32–40 S Latitude) we evaluated MODIS satellite-derived fire detections and compared this data with Chilean Forest Service records for the period 2001–2017. MODIS burned area estimates provide a spatially and temporally comprehensive record of fire activity across an important bioclimatic transition zone between dry Mediterranean shrublands/ sclerophyllous forests and wetter deciduous-broadleaf evergreen forests. Results suggest fire activity was highly variable in any given year, with no statistically significant trend in the number of fires or mean annual area burned. Evaluation of the variables associated with spatiotemporal patterns of fire for the 2001–2017 period indicate vegetation type, biophysical conditions (e.g., elevation, slope), mean annual and seasonal climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation) and mean population density have the greatest influence on the probability of fire occurrence and burned area for any given year. Both the number of fires and annual area burned were greatest in warmer, biomass-rich lowland Bío-Bío and Araucanía regions. Resource selection analyses indicate fire ‘preferentially’ occurs in exotic plantation forests, mixed native-exotic forests, native sclerophyll forests, pasture lands and matorral, vegetation types that all provide abundant, flammable and connected biomass for burning. Structurally and compositionally homogenous exotic plantation forests may promote fire spread greater than native deciduous-Nothofagaceae forests which were once widespread in the southern parts of the study area. In the future, the coincidence of warmer and drier conditions in landscapes dominated by flammable and fuel-rich forest plantations and mixed native-exotic and sclerophyll forests are likely to further promote large fires in south-central Chile. © 2018 McWethy et al.

AB  - Drier climatic conditions will be the future scenario in many regions worldwide, including southern South America. Few studies have characterized the ecophysiological vulnerability of the endemic tree species that inhabit this area, to climate change. In this study we assessed the hydraulic vulnerability of the longest-lived tree of the Southern Hemisphere, Fitzroya cupressoides, focusing on adult trees and saplings from two highly disturbed populations: the Coastal Range (AC) and Central Depression (FN) of southern Chile, which represent contrasting site conditions. This, as a basis for the design of conservation strategies to safeguard the persistence of these endangered forests in a drier future. We assessed water potentials (WP) throughout a growing season, their relationships with environmental conditions, as well as leaf and stem (branch) traits and hydraulic safety margins. Despite that the studied summer was the second driest in the last seven decades, minimum WP were not that negative (−1.3 to −1.5 MPa); which could be partly explained by a high leaf capacitance in this species. Adult trees and saplings from both sites did not significantly differ in their WP at turgor loss point, and their associated leaf safety margins, which were relatively low in all cases. However, they significantly differed in the xylem WP causing a 50% loss of stem conductivity (P50): adults AC: −5.14, saplings AC: −2.53, adults FN: −3.71, and saplings FN: −3.87 MPa. These values led to a relatively large stem safety margin (SSM) in most cases, and their variation was not explained neither by wood density, nor by tracheid size changes. Moreover, there appears to be an ontogenic adjustment in the more restrictive site AC, which was not seen in FN. Within the continuum of species strategies to cope with water stress, Fitzroya has features of the two ends of the continuum: tissues with large SSM, and tissues that sustain milder operation pressures through capacitance. Although Fitzroya appears to be relatively resistant to water scarcity, saplings from AC, seem to be the most vulnerable to the aridification trend in southern Chile. Moreover, future drying could become a significant extra threat to the highly endangered Central Depression population. Conservation actions are urgently needed to secure the future of Fitzroya forests in southern Chile.

AB  - Impacts of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.

AB  - Recent literature reports a fair amount of initiatives on how to engage younger populations in achieving computational literacy. However, there is considerable less research on how to effectively deliver software development skills in a way that can be accepted and ultimately adopted by this user group. As a way to bridge this gap, we ran an extracurricular project-based workshop, targeting 10-12 years old learners with no prior coding experience, delivered over five days in the computer labs at the University of Chile. In this workshop, participants follow hands-on activities where they acquire the basics of computer programming and develop a small-scale software application using Scratch. These activities showcase that good software engineering practices can be taught to K-6 students, where these students are guided by experienced computer science undergraduate and graduate students. This paper presents a descriptive case study that focuses on assessing how K-6 learners assimilate and use these practices when developing their first computing application in a non-traditional learning experience. In order to do this, we designed and calibrated a rubric to evaluate the software products generated by the workshop participants. Our findings provide further evidence that it is indeed possible to teach initial notions of software engineering to this user group, structuring these constructs in a non-technical language that can be assimilated by novice developers. Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in this matter according to gender and socio-economic status.

AB  - In January 2017, hundreds of fires in Mediterranean Chile burnt more than 5000 km2, an area nearly 14 times the 40-year mean. We contextualize these fires in terms of estimates of global fire intensity using MODIS satellite record, and provide an overview of the climatic factors and recent changes in land use that led to the active fire season and estimate the impact of fire emissions to human health. The primary fire activity in late January coincided with extreme fire weather conditions including all-time (1979–2017) daily records for the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and maximum temperature, producing some of the most energetically intense fire events on Earth in the last 15-years. Fire activity was further enabled by a warm moist growing season in 2016 that interrupted an intense drought that started in 2010. The land cover in this region had been extensively modified, with less than 20% of the original native vegetation remaining, and extensive plantations of highly flammable exotic Pinus and Eucalyptus species established since the 1970s. These plantations were disproportionally burnt (44% of the burned area) in 2017, and associated with the highest fire severities, as part of an increasing trend of fire extent in plantations over the past three decades. Smoke from the fires exposed over 9.5 million people to increased concentrations of particulate air pollution, causing an estimated 76 premature deaths and 209 additional admissions to hospital for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. This study highlights that Mediterranean biogeographic regions with expansive Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations and associated rural depopulation are vulnerable to intense wildfires with wide ranging social, economic, and environmental impacts, which are likely to become more frequent due to longer and more extreme wildfire seasons.

T2  - Research in Transportation Economics
AB  - This paper synthesizes evidence from Workshop 8 ‘Big data in the digital age and how it can benefit public transport users’ of the 15th International Conference on Competition and Ownership in Land Passenger Transport. Big data in public transportation has increasingly attracted the attention from both scientists and practitioners, resulting in an increasing number of scientific studies and practical applications in this field. However, compared to the scientific developments, we see that practical big data applications are relatively limited, and that these are applied with a relatively low pace. This indicates that big data has not been used to its full potential in practice yet, meaning that public transport passengers currently do not fully benefit from the opportunities big data offers in terms of public transport quality and attractiveness. Based on literature study and input gained from a qualitative expert session with scientists, public transport authorities, public transport operators and transport consultants together during the conference workshop, we come to the conclusion that the challenges to stimulate further and faster use of big data in practice are institutional rather than technical. This complexity results from required coordination and cooperation among public and private entities that are not always aligned. A framework has been proposed with four components to stimulate a further and faster adoption of big data in practice, directing to different stakeholders or relations between stakeholders: align technical ambitions of big data applications with their institutional environment; enable/ease the use of big data by PT authorities by developing common definitions, data standards and consolidation; incorporate the use of big data by PT operators in the contract between authority and operator; quantify and visualize the business value of big data for PT operators. We illustrate our framework by successful case studies in Chile, the Netherlands and Sweden.

AB  - We present a high-resolution precisely dated terrestrial paleovegetation/paleoclimate record from Lago Pichilaguna, northwestern Patagonia (40°–44°S), which spans continuously from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We find abundant and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (chiefly Nothofagus) during the LGM, accompanied by other trees, shrubs, and alpine herbs. These results suggest Subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodlands under a cold and hyperhumid climate during the LGM (∼25,000–17,800 cal. yr BP) with expansion of Nothofagus under relatively warm interstadial conditions between 25,000 and 19,200 cal. yr BP. This was followed by cooling and a precipitation increase between 19,200 and 17,800 cal. yr BP, which was contemporaneous with the youngest LGM advance of Andean glaciers in the region and maximum influence of the Southern Westerly Wind (SWW). The Last Glacial Termination (T1) started at 17,800 cal. yr BP and featured the spread of thermophilous trees and ferns characteristic of North Patagonian rainforests, along with lake level lowering. These results suggest a warm pulse and southward shift of the SWW, concurrent with a rapid collapse of Andean glacier lobes. Subsequent changes led to the establishment of closed-canopy rainforests under peak interstadial warmth between ∼16,000 and 15,000 cal. yr BP. We detect a shift to cold/wet conditions during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,800–12,700 cal. yr BP) and a precipitation decline during Younger Dryas time, followed by maximum temperature, relatively lower lake level and minimum SWW influence between 11,300 and 7700 cal. yr BP. Precipitation then rose punctuated by centennial-scale variations since 6200 cal. yr BP. Chilean-European deforestation and spread of invasive exotic species started at ∼350 cal. yr BP aided by fire. We conclude that temperate rainforests have persisted with little interruption since T1, with major changes in floristic composition driven by climate change and fires. Rainforest composition and heterogeneity declined in response to Chilean/European disturbance during the 1600s and intensified since the 1800s. These events constitute the fastest/largest-magnitude vegetation changes of the last ∼25,000 years.

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a microbial process that consumes dissolved methane (CH4) in anoxic sediments and soils and mitigates CH4 release to the atmosphere. The degree to which AOM limits global biospheric CH4 emissions is not fully understood. In marine sediments, where the process was first described, AOM is responsible for oxidizing >90% of the CH4 produced. More recently, AOM has been observed in soils, peatlands, and freshwater ecosystems. In lakes, where sediment anoxia, organic carbon turnover, and CH4 production are common, AOM is not well studied but could represent a significant CH4 sink and constraint on emissions. Here, we present evidence for the occurrence of AOM in the sediment of thirteen lakes that span a global climatic and trophic gradient. We further quantified and modeled AOM patterns and studied potential microbial controls of AOM using laboratory incubations of sediment and stable isotope measurements in three of the thirteen lakes. We demonstrate that AOM is widespread in freshwater lake sediments and accounts for 29%–34% (95% confidence interval) of the mean total CH4 produced in surface and near-surface lake sediments.

AB  - In order to ensure the provision of goods and services from forests, many governments have promoted less-traditional conservation initiatives such as programs of payments for ecosystem services called, more broadly, direct payments for conservation. The Socio Bosque Program (SBP) is a governmental program in Ecuador that directly provides economic incentives to rural families and local and indigenous communities who have voluntarily agreed to comply with some conservation activities. An impact evaluation method (matching) was used to assess the impact of the SBP between 2008 and 2014. This study revealed that on average, the SBP reduced deforestation by 1.5% in those forests that received the SBP’s direct payment. These forests would have been deforested if the SBP had not been implemented. Assessment of the impact of the SBP on individual and collective contracts, using the matching method, revealed that 3.4% and roughly 1% of the forest would have been deforested in the absence of the program, respectively. In other words, the protected area in the collective SBP was 1,247,500 ha and, if the SBP had not been implemented, an area of 11,227 ha would have been lost between 2008 and 2014. The 165,700 ha protected by the individual SBP, it was estimated that 5,733 ha were not deforested due to the implementation of the conservation program. Conventional estimates of the impact of the SBP tend to overestimate avoided deforestation because they do not control for observable covariates that correlate with or affect both SBP participation and deforestation. The conclusions are robust, even given potential hidden biases. The present study demonstrated that the SBP serves to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially with those contracts that are intended for individual owners.

T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate postfire regeneration patterns of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests on the west slope of the Andes; to evaluate the relationship between remotely sensed burn severity and forest mortality; and to assess controls of burn severity on forest response at local spatio-temporal scales. Location: Araucanía region in the western Andean Range of south-central Chile where fire occurred during the 2001–2002 season. Methods: Sampling of prefire stand structure and postfire vegetation response was performed along a burn severity gradient a decade after the fire. We evaluated the relationship between field-measured tree mortality and satellite-derived burn severity using a generalized linear model. We fit zero-inflated mixture models to regeneration data of each genus to assess the importance of abiotic variables, stand characteristics, and biotic interactions. Results: The relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio explained 85% of the variability in canopy mortality. Nearly 12,000 hectares burned; the majority at high severity (67%). Regeneration densities of both genera were lower at higher levels of burn severity and higher with greater total basal area (live, dead, and down trees). The relative effect size of burn severity on regeneration was nearly twice as large for Nothofagus, which suggests information legacies of Araucaria have cascading effects on postdisturbance material legacies. Main conclusions: Araucaria-Nothofagus mortality from wildfire can be readily mapped using satellite-derived burn severity. Although environmental site characteristics and biotic interactions mediate regeneration, basal area, and burn severity are the main mechanisms controlling regeneration. Forest refugia and postfire regeneration are vulnerable to recurrent fire. Therefore, we expect future fire (either increased severity or frequency), driven by landscape level changes, as a potential mechanism that can reduce local resilience of these forests as initial postfire material legacies (e.g., refugia and regeneration) are removed from the landscape. Our findings highlight an approach to quantify important attributes of forest disturbance and refugia, and identify areas for monitoring postdisturbance regeneration as the forests throughout south-central Chile and Argentina face a multitude of potential change agents.

AB  - Cyanophages are viruses with a wide distribution in aquatic ecosystems, that specifically infect Cyanobacteria. These viruses can be readily isolated from marine and fresh waters environments; however, their presence in cosmopolitan thermophilic phototrophic mats remains largely unknown. This study investigates the morphological diversity (TEM), taxonomic composition (metagenomics), and active infectivity (metatranscriptomics) of viral communities over a thermal gradient in hot spring phototrophic mats from Northern Patagonia (Chile). The mats were dominated (up to 53%) by cosmopolitan thermophilic filamentous true-branching cyanobacteria from the genus Mastigocladus, the associated viral community was predominantly composed of Caudovirales (70%), with most of the active infections driven by cyanophages (up to 90% of Caudovirales transcripts). Metagenomic assembly lead to the first full genome description of a T7-like Thermophilic Cyanophage recovered from a hot spring (Porcelana Hot Spring, Chile), with a temperature of 58°C (TC-CHP58). This could potentially represent a world-wide thermophilic lineage of podoviruses that infect cyanobacteria. In the hot spring, TC-CHP58 was active over a temperature gradient from 48 to 66°C, showing a high population variability represented by 1979 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). TC-CHP58 was associated to the Mastigocladus spp. by CRISPR spacers. Marked differences in metagenomic CRISPR loci number and spacers diversity, as well as SNVs, in the TC-CHP58 proto-spacers at different temperatures, reinforce the theory of co-evolution between natural virus populations and cyanobacterial hosts. Considering the importance of cyanobacteria in hot spring biogeochemical cycles, the description of this new cyanopodovirus lineage may have global implications for the functioning of these extreme ecosystems.

AB  - Though tree-ring chronologies are annually resolved, their dating has never been independently validated at the global scale. Moreover, it is unknown if atmospheric radiocarbon enrichment events of cosmogenic origin leave spatiotemporally consistent fingerprints. Here we measure the 14C content in 484 individual tree rings formed in the periods 770–780 and 990–1000 CE. Distinct 14C excursions starting in the boreal summer of 774 and the boreal spring of 993 ensure the precise dating of 44 tree-ring records from five continents. We also identify a meridional decline of 11-year mean atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations across both hemispheres. Corroborated by historical eye-witness accounts of red auroras, our results suggest a global exposure to strong solar proton radiation. To improve understanding of the return frequency and intensity of past cosmic events, which is particularly important for assessing the potential threat of space weather on our society, further annually resolved 14C measurements are needed.

AB  - Although lakes are important sources of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere contributing to global warming, their CH4 and CO2 emissions are rarely assessed. In particular, increasing inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may affect gas dynamics and alter seasonal changes in gas production. Here, we analysed variations in CH4 and CO2 dynamics in sub-basins of an acidic bog lake, which was artificially divided into four quarters three decades ago, leading to divergence in water chemistry and biology. In the divided lake, only the south-west basin (SW) received DOC inputs from an adjacent peat bog, while the north-east basin (NE) was hydrologically disconnected. A year-long determination of CH4 and CO2 production and emission patterns in the two contrasting basins exposed the indirect mechanisms by which DOC supply exercised control on greenhouse gas dynamics in this shallow lake. In both basins, dissolved CH4 was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (O2) through the water column, suggesting that aerobic methanotrophy is an important regulator of CH4 emissions in this lake. In contrast, the amount of CO2 stored in oxic and anoxic layers was not significantly different between the basins, suggesting that O2 is not the most important driver of dissolved CO2. Estimated total CH4 and CO2 emissions were 2.1 and 1.7 times lower in the NE basin than in the SW basin, with major CH4 and CO2 emissions occurring during the fall turnover. The differences in CH4 and CO2 emissions suggest that the hydro-physical properties, namely seasonal temperature, the duration of stratification and O2 availability, are the main drivers of CH4 and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from small shallow lakes under the influence of DOC inputs under global warming pressure.

AB  - On March 24-26, 2015, the Chilean city of Copiapó (27° 22′ S, 70° 20′ W), located in the hyperarid Atacama Desert, suffered an intense flooding brought by an extreme, unique rainfall event with a 35-year record of daily precipitation. A receptor model (positive matrix factorization, version 5) analysis, applied to ambient PM10 chemical speciation from three short-term sampling campaigns, resolved four sources: crustal/road dust, sea salt, secondary sulfates, and emissions from Paipote copper smelter located 8 km east of Copiapó. Wind trajectories computed with US NOAA’s Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) supported the above source identification and explained variability in source contributions. It was found that crustal/road dust increased 50 μg/m3, in April 8-10, 2015, as compared with values in November 2014 and October-November 2015, respectively. This was the dominant PM10 source after the flooding and before debris were cleaned up, being on order of magnitude higher that the other source contributions. The Paipote copper smelter contributed with primary PM10 emissions and secondary sulfates; this combined contribution averaged 11.8 μg/m3. Sea salt contributions contributed an average of 3.3 μg/m3. In normal conditions, crustal/road dust averaged 2.9 μg/m3, but the other resolved sources also contributed with crustal elements as their emissions are transported by winds to Copiapó. The positive matrix factorization solution included an unresolved concentration of 7.4 μg/m3. The small number of samples and the lack of measurements of nitrate, ammonia, and organic and elemental carbon may explain this result. Hence, sources such as secondary nitrates and combustion sources plus fugitive dust from sources surrounding Copiapó might be included in that unresolved concentration.

AB  - The Amazon basin is the largest watershed on Earth. Although the variability of the Amazon hydrological cycle has been increasing since the late 1990s, its underlying causes have remained elusive. We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.

AB  - Larger volumes of sea ice have been thawing in the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) during the last decades than during the past 800,000 years. Brackish brine (fed by meltwater inside the ice) is an expanding sympagic habitat in summer all over the CAO. We report for the first time the structure of bacterial communities in this brine. They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4–9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3–34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW. The dominant phylotypes in IB were related to Candidatus Aquiluna and Flavobacterium, those in SW to Balneatrix and ZD0405, and those shared between the habitats to Halomonas, Polaribacter and Shewanella. A meta-analysis for the oligotrophic CAO showed a pattern with Flavobacteriia dominating in melt ponds, Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria in solid ice cores, Flavobacteriia, Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in brine, and Alphaproteobacteria in SW. Based on our results, we expect that the roles of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the CAO will increase with global warming owing to the increased production of meltwater in summer. IB contained three times more phylotypes than SW and may act as an insurance reservoir for bacterial diversity that can act as a recruitment base when environmental conditions change.

AB  - Freshwater systems are subjected to multiple anthropogenic stressors and natural disturbances that act as debilitating agents and modifiers of river systems, causing cumulative and synergistic effects that deteriorate their health and result in watershed vulnerability. This study proposes an easy-to-apply spatial method of watershed vulnerability evaluation using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the Andalién River watershed, located in the Chilean mediterranean. A watershed vulnerability index (WVI) based on three sub-indices – anthropogenic stressors, environmental fragility and natural disturbances – was developed. To determine the index grouping weights, expert surveys were carried out using the Delphi method. We subsequently normalized and integrated the factors of each sub-index with relative weights. The ranges of each thematic layer were re-classified to establish vulnerability scores. The watershed was divided into three sections: headwaters zone, transfer zone and depositional zone. The watershed vulnerability index showed that 41% of the watershed had very low vulnerability and 42% had medium vulnerability, while only 1% – in the depositional zone – had high vulnerability. A one-way ANOVA was carried out to analyze the vulnerability differences among the three sections of the watershed; it showed significant differences (F (2, 16) = 8.15: p < 0.05). The a posteriori test showed differences between the headwaters and depositional zones (Tukey test, p = 0.005) and between the transfer and depositional zones (Tukey test, p = 0.014). To validate the WVI, water quality was measured at 16 stations in the watershed; there was a significant correlation between vulnerability level and NO2 − levels (r = 0.8; p = 0.87; α = 0.05) and pH (r = 0.8; p = 0.80; α = 0.05). The WVI showed the cumulative effects of multiple stressors in the depositional zone of the watershed. This is the first study to evaluate and validate non-regulated watershed vulnerability with GIS using multiple anthropogenic and natural stressors.

AB  - We conduct a global comparison of the consumption of energy by human populations throughout the Holocene and statistically quantify coincident changes in the consumption of energy over space and time—an ecological phenomenon known as synchrony. When populations synchronize, adverse changes in ecosystems and social systems may cascade from society to society. Thus, to develop policies that favor the sustained use of resources, we must understand the processes that cause the synchrony of human populations. To date, it is not clear whether human societies display long-term synchrony or, if they do, the potential causes. Our analysis begins to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the long-term synchrony of human societies, and we hypothesize that the synchrony of human populations results from (i) the creation of social ties that couple populations over smaller scales and (ii) much larger scale, globally convergent trajectories of cultural evolution toward more energy-consuming political economies with higher carrying capacities. Our results suggest that the process of globalization is a natural consequence of evolutionary trajectories that increase the carrying capacities of human societies.

AB  - Current scientific evidence shows that humans colonized South America at least 15,000 years ago, but there are still many unknown aspects of this process, including the major and minor migratory routes involved, and the pattern of successive occupation of a diverse continental mosaic of ecosystems. In this context, the role of the Andean highlands ( 3400 meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate. Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the high Andes constitutes an important “megapatch” that should be assessed in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology and technological processes involved are recognized over vast territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition, which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the Pacific coastal corridor.

AB  - The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric interannual variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extra-tropics. Here, we assess the stationarity of SAM spatial correlations with instrumental and paleoclimate proxy data for the past millennium. The instrumental period shows that temporal non-stationarities in SAM teleconnections are
not consistent across the SH land areas. This suggests that the influence of the SAM index is modulated by regional effects.
However, within key-regions with good proxy data coverage (South America, Tasmania, New Zealand), teleconnections are mostly stationary over the instrumental period. Using different stationarity criteria for proxy record selection, we provide
new austral summer and annual mean SAM index reconstructions over the last millennium. Our summer SAM reconstructions are very robust to changes in proxy record selection and the selection of the calibration period, particularly on the
multi-decadal timescale. In contrast, the weaker performance and lower agreement in the annual mean SAM reconstructions
point towards changing teleconnection patterns that may be particularly important outside the summer months. Our results clearly portend that the temporal stationarity of the proxy-climate relationships should be taken into account in the design of comprehensive regional and hemispherical climate reconstructions. The summer SAM reconstructions show no significant relationship to solar, greenhouse gas and volcanic forcing, with the exception of an extremely strong negative anomaly following the AD 1257 Samalas eruption. Furthermore, reconstructed pre-industrial summer SAM trends are very similar to
trends obtained by model control simulations. We find that recent trends in the summer SAM lie outside the 5–95% range
of pre-industrial natural variability.

AB  - Forest monitoring is important for decision making of forest management and conservation. In Chile, the forest monitoring system was initiated in 1994, which has been continued through the implementation of regional updates. This has enabled a temporal monitoring of the distribution and surface covered by native forest. However, while regional updates have reported increase in the surface covered by native forest, other studies have shown an opposite trend. Therefore, the capacity of the forest monitoring system to measure the temporal variation in forest areas was evaluated. Specifically, a review of reports and official data of the national forest monitoring system was carried out through the fulfillment of three basic criteria: i) comparability, ii) replicability and iii) quality. According to our results, the Chilean forest monitoring system does not fulfill their basic requirements because: (i) methodologies have not been consistent over time; (ii) it does not provide a baseline of land cover or forest loss that allows comparisons with changing forest area; iii) there is not adequate error estimation and how it can affect the results and analysis  of monitoring. The national forest monitoring system requires a redefinition of its aims and methods, guiding them to the long term by convening different stakeholders looking for a national agreement.

Rechazando  las acusaciones  de  ‘clausura  empírica’  levantadas  respecto  de  la  Teoría  de  Sistemas  Sociales  de  Niklas Luhmann,  afirmamos  por  el  contrario  que  esta  proporciona  una  plataforma  epistemológica  y  teórica privilegiada   para   hacer   frente   al   citado   dilema,   explicitando   las   condiciones   para   producir   un razonamiento de tipo ‘abductivo’. Dialogando, porun lado, con la comprensión de Luhmann respecto del  conocimiento  y  de  la  ciencia,  y  por  el  otro,  con  diversos  intentos  para  aplicar  empíricamente  la propuesta  sistémica  e  integrarla  con  otros  enfoques  analíticos,  el  presente paperofrece  un  modelo generalpara comprender el rol y la relación de los principios de plausibilidad teórica y fundamentación empírica en la investigación social. A partir de ello, el artículo identifica los criterios de ‘isomorfismo’, ‘perspectivismo’,  ‘transparencia’  e  ‘iterabilidad’  como  indicadores  de  aceptabilidad  científica  de  una investigación  sistémico-constructivista,  y  ofrece  orientaciones  para  el  diseño  de  un  proceso  de investigación de este tipo.

AB  - Large-scale climatic forcing is impacting oceanic biogeochemical cycles and is expected to influence the water-column distribution of trace gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. Our ability as a scientific community to evaluate changes in the water-column inventories of methane and nitrous oxide depends largely on our capacity to obtain robust and accurate concentration measurements that can be validated across different laboratory groups. This study represents the first formal international intercomparison of oceanic methane and nitrous oxide measurements whereby participating laboratories received batches of seawater samples from the subtropical Pacific Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Additionally, compressed gas standards from the same calibration scale were distributed to the majority of participating laboratories to improve the analytical accuracy of the gas measurements. The computations used by each laboratory to derive the dissolved gas concentrations were also evaluated for inconsistencies (e.g., pressure and temperature corrections, solubility constants). The results from the intercomparison and intercalibration provided invaluable insights into methane and nitrous oxide measurements. It was observed that analyses of seawater samples with the lowest concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide had the lowest precisions. In comparison, while the analytical precision for samples with the highest concentrations of trace gases was better, the variability between the different laboratories was higher: 36% for methane and 27% for nitrous oxide. In addition, the comparison of different batches of seawater samples with methane and nitrous oxide concentrations that ranged over an order of magnitude revealed the ramifications of different calibration procedures for each trace gas. Finally, this study builds upon the intercomparison results to develop recommendations for improving oceanic methane and nitrous oxide measurements, with the aim of precluding future analytical discrepancies between laboratories.

AB  - Composition, carbon and nitrogen uptake, and gene transcription of microbial mat communities in Porcelana neutral hot spring (Northern Chilean Patagonia) were analyzed using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and isotopically labeled carbon ((HCO3)-C-13) and nitrogen ((NH4Cl)-N-15 and (KNO3)-N-15) assimilation rates. The microbial mat community included 31 phyla, of which only Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant. At 58 degrees C both phyla co-occurred, with similar contributions in relative abundances in metagenomes and total transcriptional activity. At 66 degrees C, filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic Chloroflexi were >90% responsible for the total transcriptional activity recovered, while Cyanobacteria contributed most metagenomics and metatranscriptomics reads at 48 degrees C. According to such reads, phototrophy was carried out both through oxygenic photosynthesis by Cyanobacteria (mostly Mastigocladus) and anoxygenic phototrophy due mainly to Chloroflexi. Inorganic carbon assimilation through the Calvin-Benson cycle was almost exclusively due to Mastigocladus, which was the main primary producer at lower temperatures. Two other CO2 fixation pathways were active at certain times and temperatures as indicated by transcripts: 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) bi-cycle due to Chloroflexi and 3-hydroxypropionate-4-hydroxybutyrate (HH) cycle carried out by Thaumarchaeota. The active transcription of the genes involved in these C-fixation pathways correlated with high in situ determined carbon fixation rates. In situ measurements of ammonia assimilation and nitrogen fixation (exclusively attributed to Cyanobacteria and mostly to Mastigocladus sp.) showed these were the most important nitrogen acquisition pathways at 58 and 48 degrees C. At 66 degrees C ammonia oxidation genes were actively transcribed (mostly due to Thaumarchaeota). Reads indicated that denitrification was present as a nitrogen sink at all temperatures and that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) contributed very little. The combination of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis with in situ assimilation rates, allowed the reconstruction of day and night carbon and nitrogen assimilation pathways together with the contribution of keystone microorganisms in this natural hot spring microbial mat.

AB  - Coastal upwelling systems off the coasts of Peru and Chile are among the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, sustaining a significant percentage of global primary production and fishery yields. Seasonal and interannual variability in these systems has been relatively well documented; however, an understanding of recent trends and the influence of climate change on marine processes such as surface cooling and primary productivity is limited. This study presents evidence that winds favorable to upwelling have increased within the southern boundary of the Humboldt Current System (35°–42°S) in recent decades. This trend is consistent with a poleward movement of the influence of the Southeast Pacific Anticyclone and resembles the spatial pattern projected by Global Circulation Models for warming scenarios. Chlorophyll a levels (from 2002 to present) determined by satellite and field-based time-series observations show a positive trend, mainly in austral spring–summer (December–January–February), potentially explained by observed increments in nutrient flux towards surface waters and photosynthetically active radiation. Both parameters appear to respond to alongshore wind stress and cloud cover in the latitudinal range of 35°S to 42°S. In addition, net annual deepening of the mixed layer depth is estimated using density and temperature profiles. Changes in this depth are associated with increasing winds and may explain cooler, more saline, and more productive surface waters, with the latter potentially causing fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and other gases, such as nitrous oxide, sensitive to changes in oxygenation. We argue that these recent changes represent, at least in part, a regional manifestation of the Anthropocene along the Chilean coast.

AB  - This article analyses high-quality hydroclimate proxy records and spatial reconstructions from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean and compares them with two Earth System Model simulations (CCSM4, MPI-ESM-P) for the Crusader period in the Levant (1095–1290 CE), the Mamluk regime in Transjordan (1260–1516 CE) and the Ottoman crisis and Celâlî Rebellion (1580–1610 CE). During the three time intervals, environmental and climatic stress tested the resilience of complex societies. We find that the multidecadal precipitation and drought variations in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean cannot be explained by external forcings (solar variations, tropical volcanism); rather they were driven by internal climate dynamics. Our research emphasises the challenges, opportunities and limitations of linking proxy records, palaeoreconstructions and model simulations to better understand how climate can affect human history.

TI  - Seasonal drought effects on the water quality of the Biobío River, Central Chile

T2  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
AB  - Quantifying the effect of droughts on ecosystem functions is essential to the development of coastal zone and river management under a changing climate. It is widely acknowledged that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts, which can affect important ecosystem services, such as the regional supply of clean water. Very little is understood about how droughts affect the water quality of Chilean high flow rivers. This paper intends to investigate the effect of an, recently identified, unprecedented drought in Chile (2010–2015), on the Biobío River water quality, (36°45′–38°49′ S and 71°00′–73°20′ W), Central Chile. This river is one of the largest Chilean rivers and it provides abundant freshwater. Water quality (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chloride, sodium, nutrients, and trace metals), during the drought (2010–2015), was compared with a pre-drought period (2000–2009) over two reaches (upstream and downstream) of the river. Multivariate analysis and seasonal Mann-Kendall trend analyses and a Theil-Sen estimator were employed to analyze trends and slopes of the reaches. Results indicated a significant decreased trend in total suspended solids and a slightly increasing trend in water temperature and EC, major ions, and trace metals (chrome, lead, iron, and cobalt), mainly in summer and autumn during the drought. The reduced variability upstream suggested that nutrient and metal concentrations were more constant than downstream. The results evidenced, due to the close relationship between river discharge and water quality, a slightly decline of the water quality downstream of the Biobío River during drought period, which could be attenuated in a post-drought period. These results displayed that water quality is vulnerable to reductions in flow, through historical and emerging solutes/contaminants and induced pH mobilization. Consequently, seasonal changes and a progressive reduction of river flow affect the ecosystem functionality in this key Chilean river. The outcomes from this research can be used to improve how low flow conditions and the effects of a reduction in the river volume and discharge are assessed, which is the case under the scenario of more frequent drought periods.

AB  - Phytoplankton blooms taking place during the warm season drive high productivity in Antarctic coastal seawaters. Important temporal and spatial variations exist in productivity patterns, indicating local constraints influencing the phototrophic community. Surface water in Chile Bay (Greenwich Island, South Shetlands) is influenced by freshwater from the melting of sea ice and surrounding glaciers; however, it is not a widely studied system. The phyto- and bacterioplankton communities in Chile Bay were studied over two consecutive summers; during a low productivity period (chlorophyll a &lt; 0.05 mg m−3) and an ascendant phototrophic bloom (chlorophyll a up to 2.38 mg m−3). Microbial communities were analyzed by 16S rRNA—including plastidial—gene sequencing. Diatoms (mainly Thalassiosirales) were the most abundant phytoplankton, particularly during the ascendant bloom. Bacterioplankton in the low productivity period was less diverse and dominated by a few operational taxonomic units (OTUs), related to Colwellia and Pseudoalteromonas. Alpha diversity was higher during the bloom, where several Bacteroidetes taxa absent in the low productivity period were present. Network analysis indicated that phytoplankton relative abundance was correlated with bacterioplankton phylogenetic diversity and the abundance of several bacterial taxa. Hubs—the most connected OTUs in the network—were not the most abundant OTUs and included some poorly described taxa in Antarctica, such as Neptunomonas and Ekhidna. In summary, the results of this study indicate that in Antarctic Peninsula coastal waters, such as Chile Bay, higher bacterioplankton community diversity occurs during a phototrophic bloom. This is likely a result of primary production, providing a source of fresh organic matter to bacterioplankton. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Understanding how human societies interacted with environmental changes is a major goal of archaeology and other socio-natural sciences. In this paper, we assess the human-environment interactions in the Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT) basin of the Atacama Desert over the last 13,000 years. By relying on a socio-environmental model that integrates ecosystem services with adaptive strategies, we review past climate changes, shifting environmental conditions, and the continuities and discontinuities in the nature and intensity of the human occupation of the PDT. As a result we highlight the importance of certain key resources such as water, an essential factor in the long-term trajectory of eco-historical change. Without water the outcome of human societies becomes hazardous. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The recent 2015-2016 El Niño (EN) event was considered as strong as the EN in 1997-1998. Given such magnitude, it was expected to result in extreme warming and moisture anomalies in tropical areas. Here we characterize the spatial patterns of temperature anomalies and drought over tropical forests, including tropical South America (Amazonia), Africa and Asia/Indonesia during the 2015-2016 EN event. These spatial patterns of warming and drought are compared with those observed in previous strong EN events (1982-1983 and 1997-1998) and other moderate to strong EN events (e.g. 2004-2005 and 2009-2010). The link between the spatial patterns of drought and sea surface temperature anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific is also explored. We show that indeed the EN2015-2016 led to unprecedented warming compared to the other EN events over Amazonia, Africa and Indonesia, as a consequence of the background global warming trend. Anomalous accumulated extreme drought area over Amazonia was found during EN2015-2016, but this value may be closer to extreme drought area extents in the other two EN events in 1982-1983 and 1997-1998. Over Africa, datasets disagree, and it is difficult to conclude which EN event led to the highest accumulated extreme drought area. Our results show that the highest values of accumulated drought area over Africa were obtained in 2015-2016 and 1997-1998, with a long-term drying trend not observed over the other tropical regions. Over Indonesia, all datasets suggest that EN 1982-1983 and EN 1997-1998 (or even the drought of 2005) led to a higher extreme drought area than EN2015-2016. Uncertainties in precipitation datasets hinder consistent estimates of drought severity over tropical regions, and improved reanalysis products and station records are required.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The impact of the 2015/2016 El Niño on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications'. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Tree-ring research in the highland tropics and subtropics represents a major frontier for understanding climate-growth relationships. Nonetheless, there are many lowland regions – including the South American Pampa biome – with scarce tree ring data. We present the first two tree-ring chronologies for Scutia buxifolia in subtropical Southeastern South America (SESA), using 54 series from 29 trees in two sites in northern and southern Uruguay. We cross-dated annual rings and compared tree growth from 1950 to 2012 with regional climate variability, including rainfall, temperature and the Palmer Drought Severity Index – PDSI, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Overall, ring width variability was highly responsive to climate signals linked to water availability. For example, tree growth was positively correlated with accumulated rainfall in the summer-fall prior to ring formation for both chronologies. Summer climate conditions were key for tree growth, as shown by a negative effect of hot summer temperatures and a positive correlation with PDSI in late austral summer. The El Niño phase in late spring/early summer favored an increase in rainfall and annual tree growth, while the La Niña phase was associated with less rainfall and reduced tree growth. Extratropical climate factors such as SAM had an equally relevant effect on tree growth, whereby the positive phase of SAM had a negative effect over radial growth. These findings demonstrate the potential for dendroclimatic research and climate reconstruction in a region with scarce tree-ring data. They also improve the understanding of how climate variability may affect woody growth in native forests – an extremely limited ecosystem in the Pampa biome.

AB  - Fjords and estuaries exchange large amounts of solutes, gases, and particulates between fluvial and marine systems. These exchanges and their relative distributions of compounds/particles are partially controlled by stratification and water circulation. The spatial and vertical distributions of N2O, an important greenhouse gas, along with other oceanographic variables, are analyzed from the Reloncaví estuary (RE) (~41° 30′ S) to the gulf of Corcovado in the interior sea of Chiloé (43° 45′ S) during the austral winter. Freshwater runoff into the estuary regulated salinity and stratification of the water column, clearly demarking the surface (&lt;5 m depth) and subsurface layer (&gt;5 m depth) and also separating estuarine and marine influenced areas. N2O levels varied between 8.3 and 21 nM (corresponding to 80 and 170 % saturation, respectively), being significantly lower (11.8 ± 1.70) at the surface than in subsurface waters in the Reloncaví estuary (14.5 ± 1.73). Low salinity and NO3 −, NO2 −, and PO4 3− levels, as well as high Si(OH)4 values were associated with low surface N2O levels. Remarkably, an accumulation of N2O was observed in the subsurface waters of the Reloncaví sound, associated with a relatively high consumption of O2. The sound is exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts from aquaculture and urban discharge, occurring simultaneously with an internal recirculation, which leads to potential signals of early eutrophication. In contrast, within the interior sea of Chiloé (ISC), most of water column was quasi homohaline and occupied by modified subantarctic water (MSAAW), which was relatively rich in N2O (12.6 ± 2.36 nM) and NO3 − (18.3 ± 1.63 μM). The relationship between salinity, nutrients, and N2O revealed that water from the open ocean, entering into ISC (the Gulf of Corcovado) through the Guafo mouth, was the main source of N2O (up to 21 nM), as it gradually mixed with estuarine water. In addition, significant relationships between N2O excess vs. AOU and N2O excess vs. NO3 − suggest that part of N2O is also produced by nitrification. Our results show that the estuarine and marine waters can act as light source or sink of N2O to the atmosphere (air–sea N2O fluxes ranged from −1.57 to 5.75 μmol m−2 day−1), respectively; influxes seem to be associated to brackish water depleted in N2O that also caused a strong stratification, creating a barrier to gas exchange. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - "Collecting fares through "smart cards" is becoming standard in most advanced public transport networks of major cities around the world. Travellers value their convenience and operators the reduced money handling fees. Electronic tickets also make it easier to integrate fare systems, to create complex time and space differentiated fare systems, and to provide incentives to specific target groups. A less-utilised benefit is the data collected through smart cards. Records, even if anonymous, provide for a much better understanding of passengers' travel behaviour as current literature shows. This information can also be used for better service planning. Public Transport Planning with Smart Card Data handles three major topics: how passenger behaviour can be estimated using smart card data, how smart card data can be combined with other trip databases, and how the public transport service level can be better evaluated if smart card data is available. The book discusses theory as well as applications from cities around the world and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike who are interested in the state-of-the-art as well as future perspectives that smart card data will bring."--Provided by publisher.

AB  - This chapter discusses the use of smart card data for evaluation of the transport system from the user’s perspective. Tools are presented that, using passive data from the public transport system, can help transport planners to achieve their goal of improving mobility and quality of life. Using as an example the case of Santiago, Chile, it is shown how detailed analyses can be performed using passive data, contributing to the understanding of the system at a very low cost. The existence of broad and precise temporal and spatial data, allows making analyses at different levels of aggregation that are critical to understand the quality of service of urban public transport systems. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We describe the stratigraphy, age, constituent geochemistry and phenocryst thermobarometry of a closely spaced Holocene tephra couplet from Volcán Melimoyu (VMm), located in the Northern Patagonian Andes. The lower tephra unit (La Junta Tephra, Mm-1) is distinctly banded comprising a dominant lower layer of rhyodacitic (∼70% SiO2) pumiceous ash and lapilli (Mm-1p) that abruptly transitions to a subordinate upper scoriaceous layer (Mm-1s) of basaltic andesite composition (∼53% SiO2). This bimodality within Mm-1 contrasts significantly with the closely overlying Santa Ana Tephra (Mm-2) that has a homogeneous trachyte-dacite (∼63% SiO2) composition and is intermediate between the two magmatic end members of Mm-1. We propose a genetic affiliation between Mm-1 and Mm-2, and that the latter event likely represents a hybridised-remnant of those discrete magmas involved in the earlier Mm-1 eruption. To test this hypothesis we applied whole rock elemental mixing and fractional crystallisation model to reproduce the composition and crystallinity of Mm-2. Results indicate that Mm-2 can be reproduced by mixing ∼70% Mm-1p with ∼30% Mm-1s, with subsequent ∼13% fractional crystallisation of plagioclase, and minor amphibole, orthopyroxene, magnetite and biotite.

Equilibrium P-T conditions calculated from Mm-1p phenocrysts point towards magma residency at moderately shallow depths (200–290 MPa, ∼7–10-km depth, 850–1000 °C), whereas Mm-1s phenocrysts indicate higher overall P-T conditions (240–480 MPa, ∼8.5–17-km depth, 1080–1150 °C). P-T conditions determined for Mm-2 (∼290 MPa, ∼10-km depth, 930–1000 °C) are similar to those of Mm-1p. There is no physical and/or geochemical evidence of mafic magma involvement in the Mm-2 eruption.

Similar compositionally bimodal tephra are known from other Northern Patagonian Andean centres (i.e. Playas Blanca-Negra Tephra, Antillanca; Lepue Tephra, Michimahuida; Ho and H3 eruptions of Hudson) suggests that the intrusion of mafic magma into more silicic magma bodies is a common occurrence throughout this Andean sector. These widely dispersed, compositionally bimodal tephra not only provide key insights into pre-eruptive magmatic conditions and triggering processes, but can also be readily identified geochemically, and thereby be more fully utilised within future hazard- and paleoenvironmental-related studies.

TI  - Water markets and social–ecological resilience to water stress in the context of climate change: an analysis of the Limarí Basin, Chile
AU  - Urquiza, Anahí

T2  - Environment, Development and Sustainability
AB  - The paper proposes an analysis of the social–ecological resilience of the Limarí Basin, an agriculture-intensive dryland in the north of Chile, featuring one of the most innovative market-based water managements and the most active water rights market in the country, but concurrently affected by an ongoing water stress situation. The Chilean water market, one of the main examples of the application of neoliberal policies in water management, has received mixed appraisals although, at present, few empirical studies evaluate the social and environmental conditions associated with their operation. This paper, on the contrary, maintains the necessity to assess the capacity of market-based models to face situations of water stress, particularly since mega-drought phenomena are projected to become a recurring and increasing problem during the following decades because of climate change. The study offers a mixed bottom-up and top-down qualitative empirical analysis of how the Chilean water market operates, providing relevant insights into four dimensions of the social–ecological resilience of the watershed: redundancy, diversity and flexibility; connectivity, collaboration and collective action; social–ecological memory and learning; self-organization and governance of system changes. The conclusion is that water scarcity is self-produced: despite the flexibility provided by market-based water management, the combined effect of strong deregulation, of the absence of territorial planning and integrated management of water resources, and of short-term attitudes and generalized mistrust, has led the system to the critical situation it is now facing.

T2  - Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are greenhouse gases and active in the depletion of the ozone layer. These gases, originating from both anthropogenic and natural sources, are mainly released to the atmosphere from coastal areas, including continental shelves, estuaries and fjords. Surface distribution of dissolved N2O and CH4 during the austral spring were described within the Magellanic Sub-Antarctic region (50–55°S, Chile) with a coastal area that has a complex system of fjords, channels, gulf and, bays. A narrow range of N2O concentrations were observed from under-saturations (∼65%), as result of freshwater/glacial flow into fjord heads, to slight super-saturations (∼120–150%) in fjord mouths and adjacent marine zones. One exception was Otway Sound, where a penguin colony is situated, with N2O levels of up to 218%. In contrast, CH4 concentrations presented a wide range of saturations between 47.9% and 483%, with a spatial distribution that mainly corresponded to the type of hydrographic/geomorphologic basin; in the southern Patagonian Andes (mostly covered by the southern Ice Fields) CH4 levels varied between 65 and 80% in the marine area, and 180% saturation in the channels and fjords; whereas in the southern Patagonian tableland (Magellan Strait) higher CH4 concentrations, up to 483% saturation, were observed apparently associated with continental inputs (peatland and tundra vegetation). N2O concentrations were positively correlated with salinity and nutrients, indicating that the majority of N2O and nutrients (except silicate) originated from the Sub-Antarctic Water Mass (SAAW), which mixes with N2O-depleated freshwater. However, CH4 concentrations did not correlate with any oceanographic variables, suggesting that they originate from local marine/terrestrial interactions. The Magellanic Sub-Antarctic region acts as a modest source of N2O and CH4, to the atmosphere with effluxes of 6.20 ± 10.13 and 16.88 ± 27.04 μmol m−2 d−1 respectively. Due to climate change and a growth in anthropogenic activities such as salmon farming, future emissions of N2O and CH4 within this remote region remain uncertain.

T2  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
AB  - This study quantifies the impact of atmospheric rivers (ARs) on precipitation in southern South America. An AR detection algorithm was developed based on integrated water vapor transport (IVT) from 6-hourly CFSR reanalysis data over a 16-yr period (2001-16). AR landfalls were linked to precipitation using a comprehensive observing network that spanned large variations in terrain along and across the Andes from 27° to 55°S, including some sites with hourly data. Along the Pacific (west) coast, AR landfalls are most frequent between 38° and 50°S, averaging 35-40 days yr-1. This decreases rapidly to the south and north of this maximum, as well as to the east of the Andes. Landfalling ARs are more frequent in winter/spring (summer/fall) to the north (south) of ~43°S. ARs contribute 45%-60% of the annual precipitation in subtropical Chile (37°-32°S) and 40%-55% along the midlatitude west coast (37°-47°S). These values significantly exceed those in western North America, likely due to the Andes being taller. In subtropical and midlatitude regions, roughly half of all events with top-quartile precipitation rates occur under AR conditions. Median daily and hourly precipitation in ARs is 2-3 times that of other storms. The results of this study extend knowledge of the key roles of ARs on precipitation, weather, and climate in the South American region. They enable comparisons with other areas globally, provide context for specific events, and support local nowcasting and forecasting. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Using in situ hydro-chemical data and MODIS-SeaWiFS ocean color images as a proxy of river plumes and phytoplankton biomass from 2000 to 2014, this study documents the temporal co-variability of river discharge, plume area, nitrate and phosphate export and phytoplankton biomass in the coastal waters off Central Chile (33º-37ºS). Five major rivers (Maipo, Mataquito, Maule, Itata and Biobío) drain into this region with annual mean discharge ranging from 120 to 1000 m3 s-1. River discharge and coastal plume area present a marked seasonal cycle, reaching maximum values during the winter rainy season (June-September). Export of riverine nutrients also peaks in winter, leading to an increase in phytoplankton biomass within the plumes that can be twice larger than the background values in coastal areas away from the river mouths. Wintertime river discharge, plume area and nutrient export are also correlated at interannual time scales. During a recent extended dry period (2010-2014), river discharges, plume areas and nutrient export clearly decreased by about 50% compared to historical values, reducing significantly the size of the chlorophyll pool within plumes off Central Chile during winter. The potential impacts of droughts are discussed in terms of coastal ecology and primary production, a highly relevant issue considering the projections of a dry climate over Central Chile in the future. Systematic evidence of mega-drought effects upon coastal productivity still does not exist, but it remains a priority to further investigate and quantify these impacts.

AB  - We introduce the first catchment dataset for large sample studies in Chile. This dataset includes 516 catchments; it covers particularly wide latitude (17.8 to 55.0°S) and elevation (0 to 6993ma.s.l.) ranges, and it relies on multiple data sources (including ground data, remote-sensed products and reanalyses) to characterise the hydroclimatic conditions and landscape of a region where in situ measurements are scarce. For each catchment, the dataset provides boundaries, daily streamflow records and basin-averaged daily time series of precipitation (from one national and three global datasets), maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, potential evapotranspiration (PET; from two datasets), and snow water equivalent. We calculated hydro-climatological indices using these time series, and leveraged diverse data sources to extract topographic, geological and land cover features. Relying on publicly available reservoirs and water rights data for the country, we estimated the degree of anthropic intervention within the catchments. To facilitate the use of this dataset and promote common standards in large sample studies, we computed most catchment attributes introduced by Addor et al. (2017) in their Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, and added several others.
We used the dataset presented here (named CAMELS-CL) to characterise regional variations in hydroclimatic conditions over Chile and to explore how basin behaviour is influenced by catchment attributes and water extractions. Further, CAMELS-CL enabled us to analyse biases and uncertainties in basin-wide precipitation and PET. The characterisation of catchment water balances revealed large discrepancies between precipitation products in arid regions and a systematic precipitation underestimation in headwater mountain catchments (high elevations and steep slopes) over humid regions. We evaluated PET products based on ground data and found a fairly good performance of both products in humid regions (r > 0.91) and lower correlation (r < 0.76) in hyper-arid regions. Further, the satellite-based PET showed a consistent overestimation of observation-based PET. Finally, we explored local anomalies in catchment response by analysing the relationship between hydrological signatures and an attribute characterising the level of anthropic interventions. We showed that larger anthropic interventions are correlated with lower than normal annual flows, runoff ratios, elasticity of runoff with respect to precipitation, and flashiness of runoff, especially in arid catchments.
CAMELS-CL provides unprecedented information on catchments in a region largely underrepresented in large sample studies. This effort is part of an international initiative to create multi-national large sample datasets freely available for the community. CAMELS-CL can be visualised from http://camels.cr2.cl and downloaded from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.894885.

AB  - This study examines the projections of hydroclimatic regimes and extremes over Andean basins in central Chile (approximate to 30-40 degrees S) under a low and high emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). A gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset based on observations is used to drive and validate the VIC macro-scale hydrological model in the region of interest. Historical and future simulations from 19 climate models participating in CMIP5 have been adjusted with the observational dataset and then used to make hydrological projections. By the end of the century, there is a large difference between the scenarios, with projected warming of approximate to + 1.2 degrees C (RCP2.6), approximate to +3.5 degrees C (RCP8.5) and drying of approximate to - 3% (RCP2.6), approximate to - 30% (RCP8.5). Following the strong drying and warming projected in this region under the RCP8.5 scenario, the VIC model simulates decreases in annual runoff of about 40% by the end of the century. Such strong regional effect of climate change may have large implications for the water resources of this region. Even under the low emission scenario, the Andes snowpack is projected to decrease by 35-45% by mid-century. In more snowmelt-dominated areas, the projected hydrological changes under RCP8.5 go together with more loss in the snowpack (75-85%) and a temporal shift in the center timing of runoff to earlier dates (up to 5 weeks by the end of the century). The severity and frequency of extreme hydroclimatic events are also projected to increase in the future. The occurrence of extended droughts, such as the recently experienced mega-drought (2010-2015), increases from one to up to five events per 100 years under RCP8.5. Concurrently, probability density function of 3-day peak runoff indicates an increase in the frequency of flood events. The estimated return periods of 3-day peak runoff events depict more drastic changes and increase in the flood risk as higher recurrence intervals are considered by mid-century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, and by the end of the century under RCP8.5.

AB  - The level of participation of communities in distributed generation projects is a fundamental challenge for energy transition processes. Based on the experience of the Ayllu Solar project in the implementation of the co-construction methodology, this article debate on the participation of the communities in the development of energy projects, identifying learning and challenges. In this context, it is emphasized that for the success of the participatory processes it is necessary to have a thorough diagnosis of the territory; develop a proposal with sociocultural relevance; establish clear rules for the operation of work teams; work with organizations previously constituted, among others key aspects. In turn, it was possible to identify four types of barriers for the implementation of the Methodology in the territory: temporal, territorial, educational and sociocultural. Finally. two critical aspects were identified for the development of projects of this type: the tension caused by the existence of several understandings in the multidisciplinary teams on the scope of local participation, on the other hand, the contradictions and difficulties marked by the distrust generated by projects that are promoted local development, but based on the development of extractive industry. Both aspects pose great challenges for the participation and sustainability of this type of projects.

AB  - Las sequías en el Altiplano tienen un alto impacto sobre la dinámica de los ecosistemas regionales y las actividades socioeconómicas de las poblaciones locales. Es por esto que identificar los patrones espaciales de distribución de las lluvias, su evolución temporal%%%y sus proyecciones futuras resultan de gran prioridad. Los objetivos del presente estudio son (1) analizar los principales patrones temporales de las variaciones hidroclimáticas en el sur del Altiplano (19º-23ºS) durante los últimos 600-700 años y (2) proveer sustento a las proyecciones hidroclimáticas para el siglo XXI. Para ello, utilizamos econstrucciones hidroclimáticas basadas en anillos de crecimiento de árboles, mediciones instrumentales de la precipitación y los resultados de un ensamble de ocho modelos predictivos de circulación general. El análisis conjunto de estos datos nos permite desarrollar una perspectiva de los cambios hidroclimáticos del siglo XXI en un contexto multicentenal. Los resultados de las reconstrucciones paleoclimáticas desarrolladas para el Altiplano han permitido caracterizar el rango de la variabilidad hidroclimática natural a diferentes escalas temporales durante los últimos 700 años. Estos%%%registros documentan una disminución sostenida de las lluvias durante la segunda mitad del siglo XX, sin precedentes en los últimos 700 años. Los resultados de los modelos de circulación general de la atmósfera señalan una marcada disminución de las lluvias en el Altiplano bajo diferentes escenarios de emisión de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI), consistente con las tendencias observadas en las reconstrucciones y los datos instrumentales durante el siglo XX.%%%Basados en estas proyecciones, el Altiplano experimentará una reducción en la precipitación fuera del rango de variabilidad natural del sistema climático registrado para el último milenio. Estos resultados alertan sobre la necesidad de planificar y aplicar estrategias adaptativas, para reducir los efectos negativos frente a la futura escasez de agua en la región.

AB  - Wildfires have important ecological and socio-economic implications worldwide. Identifying the major ecological drivers regulating fire activity across space and time is critical to formulating sustainable policies of landscape planning and management under global change scenarios. However, large scale studies quantifying the relative importance of relevant fire drivers across different time periods are largely lacking. We conducted a high-resolution spatial survey in Central Chile and used structural equation models (SEMs) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climate, human impact, land uses, and topography on the number of fires and burned area across two distinct periods of time (2000–2005 and 2011–2016). Mean temperature and agricultural use had the highest direct positive effect on the number of fires and burned area in the two studied periods, and thus were the major ecological predictors of fire activity. Human impact was also an important predictor of fire attributes. Topography had multiple indirect effects on fire activity by regulating land use, temperature, and human impact, but direct effects were negligible. Precipitation seasonality, drought and aridity indexes, native forests, and plantations, were less relevant predictors of fire activity. Even so, our SEMs suggested that areas dominated by native forests tended to have lower number of fires than those covered by croplands or plantations. Our results suggest that fire activity in Central Chile will be highly sensitive to increases in human pressure, land use change and warming by climate change. Because the relative importance of the predictors of fire activity was steady over time, the knowledge derived from this study provides critical insights for preventive fire management and landscape planning. The control of stubble burning, native forest restoration and sustainable forestry management could improve social adaptation to a fire-prone future.

AB  - Camelid caravans have played a key role in the complex systems of interregional social interaction that characterizes Andean history. In the northernmost region of Chile, the most frequent archaeological indicators of these caravan systems are trails and rock art images. Cruces de Molinos (LL-43), a rock art site in the Lluta valley, 1100 masl, 40 km from the Pacific littoral, expands the ceremonial role of rock art sites, materialized, not only as regards the iconography portrayed and alluding to these practices, but also in terms of articulated carcass remains and detached anatomical units of camelids, intentionally deposited in a cache beneath one of the engraved blocks. This paper analyzes the site considering the visual imagery, spatial location, archaeological deposits and features associated with rock art.

Based on the predominance of camelid and caravan motifs in rock art images, the extraordinary setting and location of the site on the valley's upper slopes, which is far removed from local settlements, but closely connected with a llama caravan trade network linking the chaupiyunga ecozone with the highlands (sierra and Altiplano ecozones), we suggest that Cruces de Molinos was not a rest stop for caravanners, but a ceremonial place, and not for local farmers, but for highland herders. According to seven accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates that place the occupation between cal. 1060–1190 CE in the Late Intermediate period.

AB  - Este artículo analiza los distintos significados del concepto de participación, para avanzar hacia un modelo más inclusivo de gobernanza del cambio climático en Chile. Para ello, se presenta una revisión bibliográfica que discute distintas epistemologías, teorías y definiciones de la participación, con énfasis en las dificultades para su implementación en el contexto chileno. Posteriormente, se revisan los mecanismos de participación ciudadana desplegados en el desarrollo de instrumentos de gobernanza del cambio climático existentes en Chile. Se distinguen tipos de participación utilizados y se identifican experiencias conducidas desde la sociedad civil y la academia. Finalmente, se discuten los alcances y las limitaciones de los modelos de participación implementados y se resalta la importancia de incrementar la influencia de la sociedad civil y de mejorar los mecanismos existentes. Esto se explica por un escenario de cambio climático que posiblemente requerirá una mayor cantidad de actores involucrados en la toma de decisiones, para anticipar posibles divisiones frente al desarrollo de acciones de adaptación o mitigación más radicales, y que al mismo tiempo demandará mayores niveles de responsabilidad, compromiso y acción de la ciudadanía.

AB  - Forest ﬁre activity has increased in recent years in central and south-central Chile. Drought conditions have been associated with the increase of large wildﬁres, area burned and longer ﬁre seasons. This study examines the inﬂuence of drought on ﬁre regimes and discusses landscape management opportunities to decrease ﬁre hazard. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the effect of the 2010–2015 Megadrought (MD) compared to 1990–2009 period on ﬁre activity (ﬁre-season length, number of ﬁres and burned area across months, ﬁre sizes, regions and vegetation cover types, simultaneity, and duration of ﬁres) in central and south-central Chile (32°–39° S), using contemporary ﬁre statistics derived from the Chilean Forest Service. For large ﬁre events (>200 ha) the average season length increased by 67 d (44%), comparing 2010–2015 to 1990–2009. Earlier and later ignition dates resulted in extended ﬁre seasons in MD years. During the MD, the number, area burned, simultaneity, and duration of large ﬁres increased signiﬁcantly compared to the control period, including the unprecedented occurrence of large ﬁres during winter. The burned area in large ﬁres increased in all vegetation types, during the MD compared to the control period, especially in the exotic plantation cover type. The regions that were most affected by ﬁre (i.e., total area burned) during the MD wereMaule, B ıo-B ıo, and Araucan ıa (35–39° S) that concentrate >75% of forest plantations in Chile. Although both maximum temperatures and precipitation are drivers of ﬁre activity, a simple attribution analysis indicates that the sustained rainfall deﬁcit during 2010–2015 was the most critical factor in the enhanced ﬁre activity. Future climate change predictions indicate more recurrent, intense, and temporally extended droughts for central and south-central Chile. Under this scenario, land-use planning and ﬁre and forest management strategies must promote a more diverse and less ﬂammable landscape mosaic limiting high load, homogenous, and continuous exotic plantations.

AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been successfully used in weather prediction, but its ability to simulate precipitation over areas with complex topography is not optimal. Consequently, WRF has problems forecasting rainfall events over Chilean mountainous terrain and foothills, where some of the main cities are located, and where intense rainfall occurs due to cutoff lows. This work analyzes an ensemble of microphysics schemes to enhance initial forecasts made by the Chilean Weather Agency in the front range of Santiago. We first tested different vertical levels resolution, land use and land surface models, as well as meteorological forcing (GFS/FNL). The final ensemble configuration considered three microphysics schemes and lead times over three rainfall events between 2015 and 2017. Cutoff low complex meteorological characteristics impede the temporal simulation of rainfall properties. With three days of lead time, WRF properly forecasts the rainiest N-hours and temperatures during the event, although more accuracy is obtained when the rainfall is caused by a meteorological frontal system. Finally, the WSM6 microphysics option had the best performance, although further analysis using other storms and locations in the area are needed to strengthen this result.

AU  - Barrios, Alonso

T2  - Forest Ecosystems
AB  - Background
Over the last decades interest has grown on how climate change impacts forest resources. However, one of the main constraints is that meteorological stations are riddled with missing climatic data. This study compared five approaches for estimating monthly precipitation records: inverse distance weighting (IDW), a modification of IDW that includes elevation differences between target and neighboring stations (IDWm), correlation coefficient weighting (CCW), multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN).

Methods
A complete series of monthly precipitation records (1995–2012) from twenty meteorological stations located in central Chile were used. Two target stations were selected and their neighboring stations, located within a radius of 25 km (3 stations) and 50 km (9 stations), were identified. Cross-validation was used for evaluating the accuracy of the estimation approaches. The performance and predictive capability of the approaches were evaluated using the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), the percent bias (PBIAS), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). For testing the main and interactive effects of the radius of influence and estimation approaches, a two-level factorial design considering the target station as the blocking factor was used.

Results
ANN and MLR showed the best statistics for all the stations and radius of influence. However, these approaches were not significantly different with IDWm. Inclusion of elevation differences into IDW significantly improved IDWm estimates. In terms of precision, similar estimates were obtained when applying ANN, MLR or IDWm, and the radius of influence had a significant influence on their estimates, we conclude that estimates based on nine neighboring stations located within a radius of 50 km are needed for completing missing monthly precipitation data in regions with complex topography.

Conclusions
It is concluded that approaches based on ANN, MLR and IDWm had the best performance in two sectors located in south-central Chile with a complex topography. A radius of influence of 50 km (9 neighboring stations) is recommended for completing monthly precipitation data.

AB  - Aunque el fenómeno de El Niño–Oscilación del
Sur (ENOS) se desarrolla en el Pacífico tropical, las
alteraciones climáticas durante sus fases extremas (El
Niño y La Niña) se extienden a gran parte del planeta
(Diaz & Markgraf, 2000). No es sorprendente entonces
que ENOS ha atraído la atención de la comunidad
científica por más de un siglo, culminando en una teoría
que describe su desarrollo y decaimiento (e.g., Neelin
et al., 1998), justificando el establecimiento de la red
de observaciones TAO-Triton y motivando el desarrollo
de la predicción climática estacional en base a modelos
estadísticos y dinámicos.

El Niño y La Niña es aun limitada, similar a la que
presentaban los pronósticos del tiempo hace unos 30
años atrás (Barnston et al., 2012). En la última década se
ha reconocido además la gran diversidad de eventos,
los que no solo difieren en su intensidad y estructura
sino que también en los mecanismos subyacentes (e.g.,
Takahashi et al., 2011; Takahashi & Dewitte 2016). Así,
ENOS no deja de sorprendernos y algunos eventos
exhiben rasgos especiales o se desarrollan sin indicios.
Ese fue el caso de tres eventos cálidos en los últimos
años: el fallido evento del 2014, El Niño Godzilla del
2015/16 y el intenso El Niño costero del verano de 2017
(Fig. 1). En este trabajo presentamos una descripción
de estos eventos, con énfasis en El Niño costero del
2017 y su posible forzante atmosférico.

ISSN 0718-5014 4 Resumen El nivel participativo de las comunidades en proyectos de generación distribuida es un desafío fundamental para los procesos de transición energética. A partir de la experiencia del proyecto Ayllu Solar en la implementación de la metodología de co-construcción, el presente artículo reflexiona sobre la participación de las comunidades en el desarrollo de proyectos energéticos, identificando aprendizajes y desafíos. Así, se destaca que para el éxito de los procesos participativos es necesario contar con un diagnóstico acabado del territorio; desarrollar una propuesta con pertinencia sociocultural; establecer reglas claras para el funcionamiento de los equipos de trabajo; trabajar con líderes y organizaciones constituidas, entre otros aspectos. A su vez, fue posible reconocer cuatro tipos de barreras para la implementación de la metodología en el territorio: temporal, territorial, educacional y sociocultural. Se identifican dos aspectos críticos para el desarrollo de proyectos de este tipo: la tensión causada por la existencia de diversos entendimientos en los equipos multidisciplinarios sobre el alcance de la participación local, y las contradicciones y dificultades marcadas por la desconfianza que generan proyectos que promueven el desarrollo local, pero reciben financiamiento desde compañías basadas en la industria extractiva.

AB  - Mining activities are usually placed in the upper basin regions, especially in developing countries, with economies that strongly rely on natural commodities. Although glaciers do not occupy a large area of these mountain ranges, they deliver vital water for downstream populations. This is especially relevant during drought periods, when winter precipitation is strongly diminished and ice melt becomes relevant. They are also a key resource for highland wetland ecosystems and paradoxically at the same time for the development of megamining projects. Regularly, for environmental impact assessments and relevant public consultations, it will be stated that water from glaciers does not constitute an important source within the basin system, even though this has not been accurately quantified. Different water sources, given by spatial, geological, and hydrological features, can be identified using a combination of ionic and isotopic information from water, thus allowing to establish their proportions downstream, where water from different origins is mixed, and also to track their evolution over seasons. This approach should be useful especially for basins with strong pressures for the exploitation and consumption of water in mountainous basins and also with special relevance for basins with little or no knowledge of their water system and reservoirs

T2  - Frontiers in Energy Research
AB  - This paper analyzes the use of “participatory futures” within the context of energy transition, paying special attention to the case of Chile's long-term energy policy. Our main aim is to question the role of “participation” in such a context and particularly, to decouple the operative function of participation from its normative function. Structurally, we argue that the construction of a joint vision of desired energy futures must be understood as a deliberate attempt at governing the energy transition by way of governing the expectations of the actors and systems involved in it. Participatory approaches can promote the co-construction of such energy futures in the form of a boundary-object, able to resonate with and provide a common reference to the actors participating in its creation. On the other hand, participatory approaches can also be a way to make transitions more democratic, subjecting it to a broader influence and control from the citizenship. These two functions of “participation” are always potentially at odds with one another. Democratizing the transition, in fact, would require producing plural, dynamical imaginaries that are responsive and accountable to the public. On the contrary, the need to make transitions governable may close-up such imaginaries and narrow-down the participatory efforts to foster their normalization and acceptability on the part of the most influential actors in the self-government of the transition. To refine and exemplify our proposal, we perform a qualitative, exploratory case study of Chile's E2050 energy policy. Our findings show that “participation” may indeed have been used in the case to align partially conflicting expectations around a collectively-defined boundary object which may then act as a form of contextual, anticipatory and polycentric governance of the transition. However, from a democratic perspective, E2050 appears as a tokenization of the public in support of a pre-eminently technical and monolithic vision enacted by the Energy Ministry and the Consultative Committee. Within this context, the actual influence of the public on the policy and the possibility for political contestation are much more questionable.

AB  - The socio-ecological sensitivity to water deficits makes Chile highly vulnerable to global change. New evidence of a multi-decadal drying trend and the impacts of a persistent drought that since 2010 has affected several regions of the country, reinforce the need for clear diagnoses of the hydro-climate changes in Chile. Based on the analysis of long-term records (50+ years) of precipitation and streamflow, we confirm a tendency toward a dryer condition in central-southern Chile (30–48°S). We describe the geographical and seasonal character of this trend, as well as the associated large-scale circulation pat- terns. When a large ensemble of climate model simulations is contrasted to observations, anthropogenic forcing appears as the leading factor of precipitation change. In addition to a drying trend driven by greenhouse gas forcing in all seasons, our results indicate that the Antarctic stratospheric ozone deple- tion has played a major role in the summer rainfall decline. Although average model results agree well with the drying trend’s seasonal character, the observed change magnitude is two to three times larger than that simulated, indicating a potential underestimation of future projections for this region. Under present-day carbon emission rates, the drying pathway in Chile will likely prevail during the next decades, although the summer signal should weaken as a result of the gradual ozone layer recovery. The trends and scenarios shown here pose substantial stress on Chilean society and its institutions, and call for urgent action regarding adaptation measures.

AB  - Since 1981, water allocation in Chile has been based on a water use rights (WURs) market, with limited regulatory and supervisory mechanisms. The volume to be granted as permanent and eventual WURs is calculated from streamflow records, if stream gauge data are available, or from hydrologic parameter transfer from gauged to ungauged catchments, usually with less than 50 years of record. To test the per- formance of this allocation system, while analyzing the long-term natural variability in water resources, we investigated a 400 year-long (1590–2015) tree-ring reconstruction of runoff and historical water rights for Perquilauquén at Quella catchment, a tributary to the Maule River in Central Chile (35°S–36°30S). Furthermore, we assess how the current legislation would perform under a projected climate scenario, based on historical climate simulations of runoff calibrated against observed data, and future projections. Our analyses indicate that the allocation methodology currently applied by the Water Authority in Chile is very sensitive to the time window of data used, which leads to an underestimation of variability and long-term trends. According to the WURs database provided by the Chilean Water Directorate, WURs at Perquilauquén at Quella are already over-allocated. Considering regional climate projections, this condition will be exacerbated in the future. Furthermore, serious problems regarding the access and quality of infor- mation on already-granted WURs and actual water usage have been diagnosed, which further encumber environmental strategies to deal with and adapt to climate change. We emphasize the urgent need for a review and revision of current water allocation methodologies and water law in Chile, which are not concordant with the dynamics and non-stationarity of hydrological processes. Water scarcity and water governance are two of the key issues to be faced by Chile in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Euro-Mediterranean climate variability in boreal winter: a potential role of the East Asian trough
AU  - Sen, Omer Lutfi

AU  - Bozkurt, Deniz
T2  - Climate Dynamics
AB  - Euro-Mediterranean climate variability has been associated mostly with the upstream atmospheric circulation and teleconnection patterns, the North Atlantic Oscillation and European blocking being the main ones. This study shows, for the first time, that the East Asian trough (EAT), a prominent circulation feature of the mid-troposphere in the downstream side, might exert a strong and significant role on the interannual variability of the Euro-Mediterranean climate during boreal winters. We performed empirical orthogonal function analysis on the regions of the EAT and Mediterranean trough (MedT), an important system modulating the climate of the region, to obtain the respective dominant modes of variability at 500-hPa geopotential heights. It appears that the leading modes, the intensity in the case of the EAT and the zonal displacement in the case of the MedT, are significantly correlated with each other (r = − 0.64, p < 0.001). Consequently, when the EAT is strong (weak), the MedT is observed in the west (east) of its climatological location resulting in a warmer (cooler) Middle East and northeastern Africa, a cooler (warmer) western Europe and northwestern Africa, and wetter (dryer) Italian, Balkan and Anatolian peninsulas. Given the fact that the EAT is also a key determinant of the East Asian winter climate, the identified mid-tropospheric link between East Asia and Mediterranean could help interpret some temperature and precipitation co-variability on the opposite sides of the Eurasian continent. We suggest that studies involving the Euro-Mediterranean climate should also consider the role of the EAT as it seems to be a potential driver of the year-to-year, perhaps longer-term, climate variability in the region.

AB  - The “blooming desert”, or the explosive development and flowering of ephemeral herbaceous and some woody desert species during years with abnormally high accumulated rainfall, is a spectacular biological phenomenon of the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (northern Chile) attracting botanists, ecologists, geo-scientists, and the general public from all over the world. However, the number of “blooming deserts”, their geographical distribution and spatio-temporal patterns have not been quantitatively assessed to date. Here, we used NDVI data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) project to reconstruct the annual land surface phenology (LSP) of the Atacama Desert using a non-parametric statistical approach. From the reconstructed LSP, we detected the “blooming deserts” as positive NDVI anomalies and assessed three dimensions of the events: their temporal extent, intensity of “greening” and spatial extent. We identified 13 “blooming deserts” between 1981 and 2015, of which three (1997–98, 2002–03, and 2011) can be considered major events according to these metrics. The main event occurred in 2011, spanning 180 days between July and December 2011, and spread over 11,136 km 2 of Atacama dry plains. “Blooming deserts” in Atacama have been triggered by the accumulation of precipitation during a period of 2 to 12 months before and during the events. The proposed three-dimensional approach allowed us to characterize different types of “blooming deserts”: with longer episodes or larger spatial distribution or with different “greening” intensities. Its flexibility to reconstruct different LSP and detect anomalies makes this method a useful tool to study these rare phenomena in other deserts in the world also.

AB  - Climate change is triggering ecological responses all over the world as a result of frequent, prolonged droughts. It could also affect ecological interactions, particularly pollination and seed dispersal, which play a key role in plant reproduction. We used a tripartite interaction with a mistletoe, its pollinator and its disperser animals to gain insight into this issue. We studied flower and fruit production, and visitation rates during average (2012) and dry (2015) austral summers. Drought in our study area affected precipitation and soil water availability. Although pollinator visits did not significantly differ in these summers, during the dry summer flower and fruit production experienced an important decline, as did seed disperser visits. Also, mistletoe mortality increased from 12% in 2012 to 23% in 2015. This empirical evidence suggests that the cascade effects of climate change may indirectly be hindering ecological interactions in the Valdivian temperate rainforest ecosystem we studied. Long‐term research is essential to provide the knowledge necessary to understand how key ecological processes may be affected in a changing world.

T2  - The Biochemical Journal
AB  - Noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of guinea-pig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer. In the presence of 1 mm-NaF, noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into the choline glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid of synaptic membranes incubated in 10 mm-Tris-HCl buffer. In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis & Rowe, 1975a). The initial rate of transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA to choline glycerophospholipid was similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleate-albumin, stimulated by noradrenaline. Transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA was not appreciably stimulated by noradrenaline, but was stimulated by ATP and MgCl2.

TI  - Estimation of atmospheric total organic carbon (TOC) – paving the path towards carbon budget closure
AU  - Yang, Mingxi
AU  - Fleming, Zoë L.
T2  - Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
AB  - The atmosphere contains a rich variety of reactive organic compounds, including gaseous volatile organic carbon (VOCs), carbonaceous aerosols, and other organic compounds at varying volatility. Here we present a novel and simple approach to measure atmospheric non-methane total organic carbon (TOC) based on catalytic oxidation of organics in bulk air to carbon dioxide. This method shows little sensitivity towards humidity and near 100% oxidation efficiencies for all VOCs tested. We estimate a best-case hourly precision of 8 ppbC during times of low ambient variability in carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide (CO). As proof of concept of this approach, we show measurements of TOCCCO during August–September 2016 from a coastal city in the southwest United Kingdom. TOCCCO was substantially elevated during the day on weekdays (occasionally over 2 ppm C) as a result of local anthropogenic activity. On weekends and holidays, with a mean (standard error) of 102 (8) ppb C, TOCCCO was lower and showed much less diurnal variability. TOCCCO was significantly lower when winds were coming off the Atlantic Ocean than when winds were coming off land if we exclude the weekday daytime. By subtracting the estimated CO from TOCCCO, we constrain the mean (uncertainty) TOC in Atlantic-dominated air masses to be around 23 ( 8) ppbC during this period. A proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was deployed at the same time, detecting a large range of organic compounds (oxygenated VOCs, biogenic VOCs, aromatics, dimethyl sulfide). The total speciated VOCs from the PTRMS, denoted here as Sum(VOC), amounted to a mean (uncertainty) of 12 ( 3) ppbC in marine air. Possible contributions from a number of known organic compounds present in marine air that were not detected by the PTR-MS are assessed within the context of the TOC budget. Finally, we note that the use of a short, heated sample tube can improve the transmission of organics to the analyzer, while operating our system alternately with and without a particle filter should enable a better separation of semi-volatile and particulate organics from the VOCs within the TOC budget. Future concurrent measurements of TOC, CO, and a more comprehensive range of speciated VOCs would enable a better characterization and understanding of the atmospheric organic carbon budget.

AB  - Guidance for large-scale restoration of natural or semi-natural linear vegetation elements that takes into account the need to maintain human livelihoods such as farming is often lacking. Focusing on a Chilean biodiversity hotspot, we assessed the landscape in terms of existing woody vegetation elements and proposed a buffer strip and hedgerow network. We used spatial analysis based on Google Earth imagery and QGIS, field surveys, seven guidelines linked to prioritization criteria and seedling availability in the region's nurseries, and estimated the budget for implementing the proposed network. The target landscapes require restoring 0.89 ha km-2 of woody buffer strips to meet Chilean law; 1.4 ha km-2 of new hedgerows is also proposed. The cost of restoration in this landscape is estimated in ca. USD 6900 per planted ha of buffer strips and hedgerows. Financial incentives, education, and professional training of farmers are identified as key issues to implement the suggested restoration actions.

AB  - We present 37 new radiocarbon (14C) measurements from mollusk shells fragments sampled along the Chilean continental margin and stored in museum collections with known calendar age. These measurements were used to estimate the modern pre-bomb regional marine 14C age deviations from the global ocean reservoir (∆R). Together with previously published data, we calculated regional mean ∆R values for five oceanographic macro regions along the coast plus one for a mid-latitude open ocean setting. In general, upwelling regions north of 42ºS show consistent although sometimes highly variable ∆R values with regional averages ranging from 141 to 196 14C yr, whereas the mid-latitude open ocean location of the Juan Fernández archipelago and the southern Patagonian region show minor, ∆R of 40±38 14C yr, and 52±47 14C yr respectively. We attribute the alongshore decreasing pattern toward higher latitudes to the main oceanographic features along the Chilean coast such as perennial coastal upwelling in northern zone, seasonally variable upwelling at the central part and the large freshwater influence upon the southern

T2  - Geology
AB  - We discovered permanently hydrated CaCl2-rich soils in Earth’s driest region, the Atacama Desert. The soils contain up to ∼15% CaCl2. X-ray diffraction indicates the rare minerals sinjarite, schoenite, and tachyhydrite. When water is added, the CaCl2 crust immediately turns white due to an apparent mineralogical phase change from sinjarite to a brine. The surfaces are nearly continuously wet due to the salt’s hygroscopicity. The Ca-enriched soils occur in rare exposures, possibly from shallow groundwater. Unlike the surface of adjacent abundant halite crusts, the CaCl2 outcrops remain continuously wet, with up to 12% water under modern, and essentially rainless, climatic conditions. The wet surface stabilizes the land surface and acts as a dust trap. The sediment began accumulating at ca. 14 ka, contains trace quantities of organic carbon, and has total nitrogen that isotopically reflects significant biologically mediated gaseous losses. These deliquescent salts are unique habitats for life within the climatic limits of life on Earth, and are a potential analog for transient liquid-water sources for microorganisms in Martian soils.

T2  - Minerva
AB  - Over the last few decades climate change has been gaining importance%%%in international scientifc and political debates. However, the social sciences, especially in Latin America, have only lately become interested in the subject and their%%%approach is still vague. Scientifc understanding of global environmental change and%%%the process of designing public policies to face them are characterized by their complexity as well as by epistemic and normative uncertainties. This makes it necessary%%%to problematize the way in which research eforts understand ‘the social’ of climate%%%change. How do ‘the climate’ and ‘the social’ interpenetrate as scientifc objects?%%%What does the resulting feld look like? Is the combination capable of promoting refexivity and collaboration on the issue, or does it merely become dispersed%%%with difuse boundaries? Our paper seeks to answer these and other related questions using Chile as a case study and examining peer-reviewed scientifc research%%%on the topic. By combining in-depth qualitative content analysis of each paper with a statistical meta-analysis, we were able to: characterize the key content and forms%%%of such literature; identify divisions and patterns within it; and, discuss some factors%%%and trends that may help explain these. We conclude that the literature displays two%%%competing trends: while it is inclined to become fragmented beyond the scope of the%%%‘mitigation’ black box, it also tends to cluster along the lines of methodological distinctions traditionally contested within the social sciences. This, in turn, highlights%%%the persistence of disciplinary divisions within an allegedly interdisciplinary feld.

T2  - Land Use Policy
AB  - Chile is one of the first documented nations to undergo a forest transition dominated by tree farm expansion. Scenario modelling can inform the possible outcomes of forest conservation policies, especially when the scenarios are rooted in the political dynamics that shaped the current legislation. In Chile, tree farms of non-native Radiata Pine and Eucalyptus provide a fast return on investment. Today, fast-growing plantations compete for land area with forest conservation, putting the unique bundle of ecosystem services provided by the latter at risk. Based on a previous political analysis, we propose scenarios projected to 2030 to compare a business-as-usual scenario with A) a conservation scenario based on strict land use restrictions B) an optimistic conservation scenario; C) an unrestricted industrial land use scenario; and D) a restricted industrial land use scenario. The scenarios differ in terms of the implemented policy instruments and the land area required for each land use. We compared these scenarios in terms of carbon stock, control of erosion and wood production, all of which are relevant in the current Chilean political debate. A conservation scenario (A), that combines incentives and restrictions, would imply the largest increase in native forest and regulation services, namely carbon stock and erosion control. In contrast, an unrestricted industrial land use scenario (C) leads to the worst outcomes in terms of erosion compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This study seeks to link political and economic processes underpinning land use change to environmental outcomes, while contributing to the larger discussion on forest policy, forest transitions and environmental outcomes. © 2019

AB  - Extreme precipitation events and multi-annual droughts, especially in arid to semi-arid subtropical regions, are among the most critical El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global climate change impacts. Here, we assess the variability of torrential rainfall during the Late Holocene and its projection into the 21st century at the southern edge of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. The analysis of historical data since the beginning of the 20th century reveals that most (76.5%) alluvial disasters in the southern Atacama Desert (26–30°S) have resulted from extreme rainfall events occurring between March and September under El Niño conditions, and more frequently during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Particular rainfall events under these ocean-climate conditions are associated with the convective phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) near the central-equatorial Pacific, resulting in warmer sea surface temperature (SST) there and in the triggering of persistent/intense Pacific South America (PSA) tropical-extratropical teleconnection patterns which result in blocking of the westerly flow at high latitudes and the subsequent deviation of storm tracks towards central-northern Chile. On a longer timescale, marine sediments from Tongoy Bay (30°S) reveal an increasing trend of stronger runoff by torrential coastal rain since ca. 3500 cal yr BP and even stronger heavy rainfall since ca. 1700 cal yr BP. Highly variable coastal sea surface temperatures in the same time span deduced from the sedimentary record can be explained by intensified southerly winds in connection with stronger alongshore pressure gradients and reduced coastal low-cloud cover. Both storm intensification and increased intensity of upwelling-favorable winds point to a variable climate conditioned by strengthened interannual ENSO and interdecadal ENSO-like variability during the Late Holocene. Climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) indicate a reduction in annual precipitation of 15–30% during the current century, together with an intensification of the storms, such as the alluvial disaster on March 25, 2015 in Atacama. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Science of The Total Environment
AB  - This study investigates the immediate and mid-term effects of the biogeochemical variables input into the Reloncaví fjord (41°40′S; 72°23′O) as a result of the eruption of Calbuco volcano. Reloncaví is an estuarine system supporting one of the largest mussels farming production within Northern Chilean-Patagonia. Field-surveys were conducted immediately after the volcanic eruption (23–30 April 2015), one month (May 2015), and five months posterior to the event (September 2015). Water samples were collected from three stations along the fjord to determine greenhouse gases [GHG: methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O)], nutrients [NO 3 − , NO 2 − , PO 4 3− , Si(OH) 4 , sulphate (SO 4 2− )], and carbonate systems parameters [total pH (pHT), temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (O 2 ), and total alkalinity (AT)]. Additionally, the impact of physicochemical changes in the water column on juveniles of the produced Chilean blue mussel, Mytilus chilensis, was also studied. Following the eruption, a large phytoplankton bloom led to an increase in pH T , due to the uptake of dissolved-inorganic carbon in photic waters, potentially associated with the runoff of continental soil covered in volcanic ash. Indeed, high surface SO 4 2− and GHG were observed to be associated with river discharges. No direct evidence of the eruption was observed within the carbonate system. Notwithstanding, a vertical pattern was observed, with an undersaturation of aragonite (Ω Ar &lt; 1) both in brackish surface (&lt;3 m) and deep waters (&gt;10 m), and saturated values in subsurface waters (3 to 7 m). Simultaneously, juvenile mussel shells showed maximized length and weight at 4 m depth. Results suggest a localized impact of the volcanic eruption on surface GHG, nutrients and short-term effects on the carbonate system. Optimal conditions for mussel calcification were identified within a subsurface refuge in the fjord. These specific attributes can be integrated into adaptation strategies by the mussel aquaculture industry to confront ocean acidification and changing runoff conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vertical profiles of black carbon (BC) and other light-absorbing impurities were measured in seasonal snow and permanent snowfields in the Chilean Andes during Austral winters 2015 and 2016, at 22 sites between latitudes 18°S and 41°S. The samples were analyzed for spectrally-resolved visible light absorption. For surface snow, the average mass mixing ratio of BC was 15 ng/g in northern Chile (18–33°S), 28 ng/g near Santiago (a major city near latitude 33°S, where urban pollution plays a significant role), and 13 ng/g in southern Chile (33–41°S). The regional average vertically-integrated loading of BC was 207 µg/m 2 in the north, 780 µg/m 2 near Santiago, and 2500 µg/m 2 in the south, where the snow season was longer and the snow was deeper. For samples collected at locations where there had been no new snowfall for a week or more, the BC concentration in surface snow was high (~10–100 ng/g) and the sub-surface snow was comparatively clean, indicating the dominance of dry deposition of BC. Mean albedo reductions due to light-absorbing impurities were 0.0150, 0.0160, and 0.0077 for snow grain radii of 100 µm for northern Chile, the region near Santiago, and southern Chile; respective mean radiative forcings for the winter months were 2.8, 1.4, and 0.6 W/m 2 . In northern Chile, our measurements indicate that light-absorption by impurities in snow was dominated by dust rather than BC. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Tropical perturbations have been shown theoretically and observationally to excite long range atmospheric responses in the form of Rossby wave teleconnections that result from the equator to pole gradient of planetary vorticity. An extreme teleconnection event occurred during March 2015 in the Southeastern Pacific. As a result, extreme high temperatures were observed in Southwestern South America and the Antarctic Peninsula simultaneously with an extreme rainfall and flood event in the hyperarid Atacama desert.%%%%%%We show that the origin of these seemingly disconnected extreme events can be traced to a Rossby wave response to the strongest Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) on record in the tropical central Pacific. A barotropic wavenumber 3 to 4 perturbation with group velocity between 15 to 30 m/s is consistent with the trajectory and timing followed by the upper level anomalies radiating away from the tropics after the MJO episode.

AB  - Land use and land cover changes (LULCC) within a highly anthropized Mediterranean landscape dominated by industrial tree plantation leads to degradation of soil physical properties. This process has been more intense in the coastal range of south-central%%%Chile due to its soils, which are highly susceptible to erosion, combined with a long history of intensive land use changes during the last century, transitioning from native forest (NF) to agriculture and the more recent establishment of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. exotic tree plantations. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the statuses of soil physical properties over different land cover situations. Historical land cover maps were determined via supervised classifications using the maximum likelihood classifier applied to satellite imagery. Five land use and land cover categories (LULC) were defined according to main land cover transitions associated with active and abandoned forestry operations that have been reported in the region: NF, pine plantation (P), eucalyptus plantation (Eu), early successional (E-S), and secondary successional (S-S). Successional stages were generated using change detection statistics considering changes between 2001 and 2014 maps. Soil samples were collected at%%%three depths in 39 plots that describe the five LULC. High clay contents were found in all%%%the LULC except Eu and P. These sites have shown more signs of degradation, with lower%%%organic matter (SOM) and macropores and higher shear strength (ShS). Soil organic matter was consistent with litter contribution and quality, establishing lower bulk density (Db) for NF and S-S and higher values for Eu and E-S. ShS and dispersion rate (DR) exhibit a correlation with SOM with lower ShS and higher DR when SOM increased. Relevant differences were identified for structural stability index (SSI) between LULC depending on soil physical quality, besides a positive correlation with SOM. Those results show the need to generate appropriate conditions of vegetation cover in order to recover soils subjected to current forestry management of industrial plantations.

A partir de encuestas y entrevistas semiestructuradas, identificamos dispositivos que favorecen la adopción de prácticas de conservación por parte de los ejidatarios propietarios de la tierra, pero que restringen el manejo forestal tradicional. Estas dinámicas generan cambios en las estrategias de subsistencia de las unidades domésticas y limitan la participación y distribución de beneficios a mujeres, jóvenes y avecindados sin propiedad de la tierra.

AB  - Alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides (Molina) I.M. Johnst., Cupressaceae), known as Lahuan by the Mapuche people, is the most iconic endemic conifer of southern Chile and adjacent Argentina (Fig. 1). It can reach monumental dimensions (up to 5 m in diameter and over 50 m in height) and has remarkable longevity (Lara et al. 1999, Clement et al. 2001, Donoso‐Zeggers 2006, Urrutia‐Jalabert et al. 2015). The oldest alerce tree recorded is over 3,600 years old, making this species the second longest‐lived tree in the world after the North American Bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D. K. Bailey) (Lara and Villalba 1993).
